Each step ensures that we adhere to the database schema and the specified conditions, leading to an optimal and accurate query.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4284, "completion_tokens": 743, "total_tokens": 5027, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_34a54ae93c"}}, "error": null}

This will ensure that the final result set includes all relevant sources classified as AGN, QSO, or Blazar.\n\n6. **Final Output Specification:**\n   - Ensure that the final output includes the specified columns: `oid`, `meanra`, `meandec`, `ndet`, `firstmjd`, `deltajd`, `g_r_mean_corr`, `classifier_name`, `class_name`, `ranking`, and `probability`.\n   - The output should be distinct if necessary, depending on the nature of the data.\n\n7. **Document the Query:**\n   - Write comments within the SQL code to explain the purpose of each part of the query.\n   - Create external documentation that describes the query's purpose, the information it retrieves, and any assumptions or limitations.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically construct a PostgreSQL query that meets the user's requirements for retrieving probabilities for sources classified as AGN, QSO, or Blazar, while applying the necessary filters and conditions.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3113, "completion_tokens": 796, "total_tokens": 3909, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_34a54ae93c"}}, "error": null}

This will involve selecting from the `object` table where `firstmjd` is between 60126.0 and 60156.0.\n   - This sub-query will return the `oid` of the objects that meet the date criteria.\n\n4. **Spatial Filtering Using Q3C Functions:**\n   - Use the `q3c_radial_query` function to filter objects based on their celestial coordinates. This will involve joining the `object` table with the results of the previous sub-query to ensure that only objects within the specified radius from the Abell 370 cluster are included.\n   - The condition will be: `q3c_radial_query(meanra, meandec, 39.97, -1.5768, 16.16667)`.\n\n5. **Filter by sgscore1 Feature:**\n   - Create a sub-query to filter the `feature` table for the `sgscore1` feature where `value < 0.3`. This will involve an INNER JOIN with the `object` table to ensure that only features associated with the filtered objects are included.\n   - This sub-query will return the `oid` of objects that meet the `sgscore1` condition.\n\n6. **Filter by Probability Conditions:**\n   - Create another sub-query to filter the `probability` table for the highest probability in the `stamp_classifier`. This will involve selecting from the `probability` table where `ranking = 1` and `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`.\n   - Additionally, filter out objects where the `class_name` is either 'Asteroid' or 'Bogus'. This can be done using a NOT IN clause or a LEFT JOIN with a condition to exclude these classes.\n\n7. **Combine Filters Using INTERSECT:**\n   - Use an INTERSECT operation to combine the results of the `sgscore1` sub-query and the `probability` sub-query. This will ensure that only objects that meet all the specified conditions are included.\n\n8. **Final Selection of Columns:**\n   - After obtaining the filtered list of `oid`s, perform a final selection from the `object` table to retrieve the required columns: `oid`, `meanra`, `meandec`.\n   - Additionally, join with the `feature` table to get the `value`, `name`, and `version` for the `sgscore1` feature.\n\n9. **Calculate Distance:**\n   - Use the `q3c_dist` function to calculate the distance from the center of the Abell 370 galaxy cluster for each object.

This will be used in the `WHERE` clause of the query.\n\n3. **Calculate the Search Radius:**\n   - Convert the search radius from arcminutes to degrees. Given that 1000 arcmin equals approximately 16.16667 degrees, we will use this value in the spatial query.\n\n4. **Set Up the Spatial Query:**\n   - Use the Q3C function `q3c_radial_query` to filter objects based on their coordinates. The center of the Abell 370 galaxy cluster is given as RA=39.97 and Dec=-1.5768. The query will check if the objects are within 16.16667 degrees of this center.\n\n5. **Filter by sgscore1 Value:**\n   - We need to filter the results to include only those objects where `sgscore1 < 0.3`. This will be done using a condition in the `WHERE` clause.\n\n6. **Sub-query for Probability Filtering:**\n   - Create a sub-query to filter the `probability` table to get the most likely probabilities for each object. This sub-query will:\n     - Filter for `ranking = 1` and `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`.\n     - Exclude objects where `class_name` is 'Asteroid' or 'Bogus'.\n\n7. **Join the Probability Sub-query with Object Table:**\n   - Perform an `INNER JOIN` between the `object` table and the filtered `probability` sub-query to ensure we only get objects that meet the probability criteria.\n\n8. **Sub-query for Feature Retrieval:**\n   - Create a sub-query to retrieve features from the `feature` table.

The distance will be calculated between the object's coordinates and the center of the Abell 370 galaxy cluster.\n\n10. **Final Query Construction:**\n    - Combine all the components into a single query that:\n      - Filters objects based on the first detection date, spatial proximity, `sgscore1` value, and probability conditions.\n      - Joins the necessary tables to retrieve the required columns.\n      - Calculates the distance using the `q3c_dist` function and aliases it as 'dist'.\n\n11. **Testing and Validation:**\n    - After constructing the query, it should be tested to ensure it returns the expected results and adheres to the specified conditions.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically construct the PostgreSQL query to retrieve the desired information from the ALeRCE database.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 5537, "completion_tokens": 786, "total_tokens": 6323, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_34a54ae93c"}}, "error": null}

Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown of the steps required to construct the query:\n\n1. **Understand the Required Information:**\n   - We need to retrieve the following columns:\n     - Object identifier (`oid`) from the `object` table.\n     - Candidate identifier (`candid`) from the `detection` table.\n     - Name and value of the feature from the `feature` table.\n     - PSF magnitudes (`magpsf`) and magnitude errors (`sigmapsf`) from the `detection` table.\n     - Band identifiers (`fid`) from the `detection` table, which will be renamed to `feature_fid`.\n\n2. **Define the Conditions:**\n   - The objects must be classified as 'SN II'.\n   - The probability of classification must be greater than 0.6.\n   - The number of detections (`ndet`) must be greater than 50.\n   - The difference between the minimum and maximum magnitudes in the ZTF g-band (`delta_mag_fid` for fid=1) must be greater than 2 mag.\n\n3. **Identify Relevant Tables:**\n   - The main tables involved are:\n     - `object`: for object identifiers and their statistics.\n     - `probability`: for classification probabilities and class names.\n     - `detection`: for detection details including candidate identifiers and magnitudes.\n     - `feature`: for features associated with the objects.\n\n4. **Create a Subquery for Object Classification:**\n   - Start by creating a subquery that filters the `probability` table to select `oid` for objects classified as 'SN II' with a probability greater than 0.6. This subquery will also ensure that we only consider the most likely classification by applying the condition `ranking = 1` and `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`.\n\n5. **Join with the Object Table:**\n   - Use an INNER JOIN between the `object` table and the subquery from step 4 to filter the objects based on the classification criteria.\n\n6. **Filter Based on Detection Criteria:**\n   - Apply a condition to filter the results where the number of detections (`ndet`) is greater than 50. This can be done directly on the `object` table.\n\n7. **Join with the Detection Table:**\n   - Perform an INNER JOIN with the `detection` table to retrieve the candidate identifiers (`candid`), PSF magnitudes (`magpsf`), magnitude errors (`sigmapsf`), and band identifiers (`fid`).\n\n8. **Filter for Magnitude Difference in g-band:**\n   - Use a subquery or a CTE (Common Table Expression) to calculate the difference between the minimum and maximum magnitudes in the g-band (where `fid = 1`). This will involve aggregating the `detection` table to find the minimum and maximum magnitudes for each `oid` and filtering for those where the difference is greater than 2.\n\n9. **Join with the Feature Table:**\n   - Perform an INNER JOIN with the `feature` table to retrieve the name and value of the features associated with the selected objects. Ensure to include the condition that the features are linked to the correct `oid`.\n\n10. **Select and Rename Columns:**\n    - In the final SELECT statement, retrieve the required columns: `oid`, `candid`, feature name, feature value, `magpsf`, `sigmapsf`, and `fid`. Rename the `fid` column to `feature_fid` as specified.\n\n11. **Order the Results:**\n    - Finally, apply an `ORDER BY` clause to sort the results by `oid`.\n\n12. **Document the Query:**\n    - Write comments within the SQL code to explain the purpose of different parts of the query and create external documentation that describes the query's purpose, the information it retrieves, and any assumptions or limitations.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically construct a PostgreSQL query that meets the user's request while ensuring optimal performance and accuracy.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 6015, "completion_tokens": 863, "total_tokens": 6878, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_34a54ae93c"}}, "error": null}
