Create a sub-query using the 'probability' TABLE filtering the desired objects.\nII. For each feature, you have to make a sub-query retrieving the specific feature adding the condition of its value, taking only the oids in the 'probability' sub-query with an INNER JOIN inside each 'feature' sub-query to retrieve only the features associated with the desired spatial objects.\nIII.

Filter the 'UNION' query from step III selecting only the 'oids' that are in the 'INTERSECT' query from step IV\nVI. Add the remaining conditions to the final result of step V, using the 'probability' sub-query from step I.\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nTo generate a PostgreSQL query that retrieves the requested information from the ALeRCE database based on the user request, follow these detailed steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Requirements:**\n   - The user wants to retrieve object identifiers (oids) and probabilities for two specific classifications: 'SNIa' with ranking 1 and 'CV/Nova' with ranking 2.\n   - The condition is that the difference between the probabilities of these two classifications must be lower than 0.1.\n   - The output should include the oids and the probabilities for each class, with the columns named 'SN_prob' for 'SNIa' and 'CV_prob' for 'CV/Nova'.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Tables:**\n   - The `probability` table is essential as it contains the classification probabilities and rankings.\n   - The `object` table may be used to retrieve additional information if needed, but the primary focus is on the `probability` table.\n\n3. **Create Sub-Queries for Each Class:**\n   - **Sub-query for 'SNIa':**\n     - Create a sub-query that selects the `oid` and `probability` from the `probability` table where `class_name` is 'SNIa' and `ranking` is 1.\n     - This sub-query will return the oids and their corresponding probabilities for 'SNIa'.\n   \n   - **Sub-query for 'CV/Nova':**\n     - Create another sub-query that selects the `oid` and `probability` from the `probability` table where `class_name` is 'CV/Nova' and `ranking` is 2.\n     - This sub-query will return the oids and their corresponding probabilities for 'CV/Nova'.\n\n4. **Join the Sub-Queries:**\n   - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the results of the two sub-queries based on the `oid`. This will ensure that only objects that have both classifications are included in the final result set.\n\n5. **Apply the Probability Difference Condition:**\n   - In the `WHERE` clause of the main query, add a condition to filter the results where the absolute difference between the probabilities of 'SNIa' and 'CV/Nova' is less than 0.1. This can be done using the `ABS()` function to calculate the difference.\n\n6. **Select the Required Columns:**\n   - In the final `SELECT` statement, specify the columns to be returned: the `oid`, the probability for 'SNIa' (aliased as 'SN_prob'), and the probability for 'CV/Nova' (aliased as 'CV_prob').\n\n7. **Document the Query:**\n   - Write comments within the SQL code to explain the purpose of different parts of the query, such as the rationale for the joins and the conditions applied.\n\nBy following these steps, you will systematically construct a PostgreSQL query that meets the user's request while ensuring that all necessary conditions and relationships are accounted for.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Get the object identifiers and probabilities in the light curve classifier for objects classified in the light curve classifier as SNIa with ranking=1 and CV/Nova with ranking=2, where the difference between the probabilities at each ranking is lower than 0.1.

The goal is to retrieve object identifiers, probabilities from the stamp classifier, light curves, and additional details for specific astronomical objects. Here\u2019s how we can break down the task into detailed steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Tables:**\n   - The main tables involved are:\n     - `object`: Contains the main statistics of the objects.\n     - `probability`: Contains classification probabilities and rankings.\n     - `detection`: Contains information about the object detections (light curves).\n     - `magstat`: Contains statistics for the object divided by band or filter.\n\n2. **Define the Selection Criteria:**\n   - We need to filter objects based on:\n     - Highest probability in the `stamp_classifier` for class 'SN'.\n     - First detection occurring between September 1 (60188.0) and September 2 (60189.0).\n     - Qualification as fast risers, defined as having a first detection brighter by at least 0.25 magnitudes/day compared to the last non-detection.\n\n3. **Subquery for Highest Probability:**\n   - Create a subquery to select `oid` from the `probability` table where:\n     - `ranking = 1` (to get the highest probability).\n     - `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`.\n     - `class_name = 'SN'`.\n   - This subquery will return the `oid` of objects that meet the probability criteria.\n\n4. **Filter Objects by First Detection Date:**\n   - Use the `object` table to filter for objects whose `firstmjd` is between 60188.0 and 60189.0.\n   - Join this with the subquery from step 3 to ensure we only consider objects that have the highest probability for class 'SN'.\n\n5. **Identify Fast Risers:**\n   - To qualify as a fast riser, we need to calculate the difference in magnitude between the first detection and the last non-detection.\n   - Create a subquery to find the last non-detection for each object before the first detection. This can be done by filtering the `detection` table for `oid` and ensuring the `mjd` is less than the `firstmjd`.\n   - Calculate the rate of brightness change (magnitude difference divided by the time difference) to check if it is at least 0.25 magnitudes/day.\n\n6. **Join Detection and Magstat Tables:**\n   - Join the `detection` table to retrieve the filter ID and candid for the detections.\n   - Also, join the `magstat` table to get the filter ID and the initial rise estimate, renaming the filter ID from `magstat` as `magstat_fid`.\n\n7. **Select Required Columns:**\n   - From the final joined result, select the following columns:\n     - `oid` (object identifier).\n     - Probability from the `probability` table.\n     - Filter ID and candid from the `detection` table.\n     - Filter ID from the `magstat` table (as `magstat_fid`).\n     - The initial rise estimate (calculated in the fast riser qualification).\n\n8. **Order the Results:**\n   - Finally, order the results by `oid` to meet the user\u2019s request.\n\n9. **Document the Query:**\n   - Write comments within the SQL code to explain the purpose of different parts of the query.\n   - Create external documentation that describes the query's purpose, the information it retrieves, and any assumptions or limitations.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically construct the SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the ALeRCE database. Each step ensures that we adhere to the requirements and conditions specified in the user request.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: -- mjd date for September 01 = 60188.0\n-- mjd date for September 02 = 60189.0\nDomain Knowledge: \n-- A fast riser is defined as an object whose first detection is brighter by at least a rate of 0.25 magnitudes/day than the last non-detection obtained before the first detection (both first detection and last non-detection are in the same filter)\n\n # User Request: ''Get the object identifiers, probabilities in the stamp classifier and light curves (only detections) for objects whose highest probability in the stamp classifier is obtained for class SN, that had their first detection in the first 2 days of september, and that qualify as fast risers.

The request involves multiple conditions and requires data from several tables. Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown of the steps required to construct the query:\n\n1. **Understand the Required Information:**\n   - The user wants to retrieve the following columns:\n     - Object identifier (`oid`)\n     - Candidate identifier (`candid`)\n     - Magnitudes (`magpsf`, `magap`, etc.)\n     - Magnitude errors (`sigmapsf`, `sigmagap`, etc.)\n     - Initial rise estimate (`dmdt_first`)\n     - Band identifiers (`fid`)\n   - The data should be filtered based on:\n     - Classification as 'SN II'\n     - Year range from 2019 to 2022\n     - Probability greater than 0.6\n     - Initial rise rate greater than 0.5 mag/day\n     - Number of detections greater than 50\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Tables:**\n   - The main tables involved are:\n     - `object`: Contains the main statistics of the objects.\n     - `probability`: Contains classification probabilities and rankings.\n     - `detection`: Contains information about the object detections, including magnitudes and errors.\n     - `magstat`: Contains statistics for the object divided by band or filter.\n\n3. **Set Default Conditions for the Probability Table:**\n   - Since the user did not specify different conditions for the `probability` table, we will apply the default conditions:\n     - `probability.ranking = 1`\n     - `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`\n\n4. **Create a Subquery for the Probability Table:**\n   - Construct a subquery to filter the `probability` table for objects classified as 'SN II' with a probability greater than 0.6. This subquery will return the `oid` of the relevant objects.\n\n5. **Join with the Object Table:**\n   - Use an INNER JOIN between the `object` table and the subquery from step 4 to filter objects based on the classification and probability conditions.\n   - Additionally, filter the `object` table for the time range (2019-2022) using the `firstmjd` and `lastmjd` columns.\n\n6. **Join with the Detection Table:**\n   - Perform an INNER JOIN with the `detection` table to retrieve the candidate identifier (`candid`), magnitudes (`magpsf`, `magap`), and magnitude errors (`sigmapsf`, `sigmagap`).\n   - Apply the condition for the number of detections greater than 50 by filtering on the `ndet` column from the `magstat` table.\n\n7. **Join with the Magstat Table:**\n   - Perform an INNER JOIN with the `magstat` table to access the `dmdt_first` column (initial rise estimate) and the `fid` (band identifier).\n   - Apply the condition for the initial rise rate greater than 0.5 mag/day using the `dmdt_first` column.\n\n8. **Select Required Columns:**\n   - In the final SELECT statement, specify the columns to retrieve:\n     - `object.oid`\n     - `detection.candid`\n     - `detection.magpsf`, `detection.sigmapsf`, `detection.magap`, `detection.sigmagap`\n     - `magstat.dmdt_first`\n     - `magstat.fid`\n\n9. **Order and Group Results (if necessary):**\n   - If the user requires the results to be ordered or grouped in a specific way, apply the appropriate `ORDER BY` or `GROUP BY` clauses.\n\n10. **Document the Query:**\n    - Write comments within the SQL code to explain the purpose of different parts of the query.\n    - Create external documentation that describes the query's purpose, the information it retrieves, and any assumptions or limitations.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically construct a PostgreSQL query that meets the user's request for retrieving information about SN II objects from the ALeRCE database.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Get the object identifier, candidate identifier, magnitudes, magnitude errors, initial rise estimate, and band identifiers as a function of time of the objects classified as SN II in the year 2019-2022, with probability larger than 0.6, initial rise rate greater than 0.5 mag/day in ZTF g and r-band and number of detections greater than 50.''"}], "max_tokens": 4000, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "n": 1}}

The request involves retrieving astronomical objects based on specific spatial coordinates, detection dates, and classification probabilities. Here are the detailed steps required to construct the query:\n\n1. **Understand the Requirements:**\n   - The user wants to find objects that are within 10 degrees of two specified celestial coordinates (source_1 and source_2).\n   - The objects must have their first detection within the first 7 days of February (from mjd 59976.0 to mjd 59982.0).\n   - The objects must have a classification probability greater than 0.4 and a ranking of 1 in the 'stamp_classifier'.\n\n2. **Define the Spatial Query:**\n   - Use the Q3C functions to perform spatial queries. Specifically, we will use `q3c_radial_query` to check if the objects are within 10 degrees of the specified coordinates.\n   - Create a temporary inline table using a `WITH` clause to define the coordinates of source_1 and source_2.\n\n3. **Filter by Detection Dates:**\n   - We need to filter the objects based on their first detection date. This will involve adding a `WHERE` clause to check if `firstmjd` is between 59976.0 and 59982.0.\n\n4. **Join with the Probability Table:**\n   - Since we need to filter based on classification probabilities, we will join the `object` table with the `probability` table.\n   - Apply the conditions that `probability.ranking = 1` and `probability.classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`.\n   - Additionally, filter for `probability.probability > 0.4`.\n\n5. **Construct the Spatial Query:**\n   - For each source in the temporary inline table, use the `q3c_radial_query` function to check if the objects are within 10 degrees of the specified coordinates.\n   - This will involve creating a sub-query for each source that checks the distance condition.\n\n6. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Use a `UNION` to combine the results from the spatial queries for both sources. This will ensure that we retrieve objects that are within the specified distance of either source.\n\n7. **Final Filtering:**\n   - After obtaining the combined results from the `UNION`, we will filter these results to ensure they meet the conditions specified in the probability table.\n   - This will involve an `INNER JOIN` with the `probability` table to ensure that only objects with the required classification probabilities and rankings are included.\n\n8. **Select the Required Columns:**\n   - Finally, select all relevant columns from the `object` table and any necessary columns from the `probability` table to provide a comprehensive result set.\n\n9. **Document the Query:**\n   - Write comments within the SQL code to explain the purpose of different parts of the query, ensuring clarity for future reference.\n\nBy following these steps, we will systematically construct a PostgreSQL query that accurately retrieves the requested information from the ALeRCE database.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: -- mjd date for February 01 = 59976.0\n-- mjd date for February 07 = 59982.0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Query objects within 10 degress of the next postitions: ('source_1', 160.18301441363647, 33.0164673528409),\n('source_2', 174.21524897555543, 44.83789535222221), and with their first detection the first 7 days of February, with SN probabilities > 0.4, and ranking=1 in the stamp classifier''"}], "max_tokens": 4000, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "n": 1}}

The user is interested in retrieving objects classified as RR Lyrae (RRL) by the light curve classifier, with specific conditions on probability and detection count. Here are the detailed steps to create the query:\n\n1. **Understand the Required Information:**\n   - The user wants to retrieve objects classified as 'RRL' (RR Lyrae) from the `probability` table.\n   - The conditions specify that the probability must be greater than 0.55 and the number of detections (`ndet`) must be 100 or more.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**\n   - The main tables involved are:\n     - `object`: This table contains the `ndet` column, which indicates the number of detections for each object.\n     - `probability`: This table contains the classification information, including `class_name`, `probability`, and `oid` (which links to the `object` table).\n   - Relevant columns:\n     - From `object`: `oid`, `ndet`\n     - From `probability`: `oid`, `class_name`, `probability`\n\n3. **Define the Query Requirements:**\n   - We need to filter the `probability` table for entries where:\n     - `class_name` is 'RRL'\n     - `probability` is greater than 0.55\n   - We also need to join this filtered result with the `object` table to access the `ndet` column.\n   - After joining, we will apply an additional filter on the `ndet` column to ensure it is 100 or more.\n\n4. **Formulate the Query Structure:**\n   - Start with a `SELECT` statement to retrieve all columns from the `object` table and the relevant columns from the `probability` table.\n   - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `probability` table with the `object` table on the `oid` column, which is the common key.\n   - Apply the necessary `WHERE` clauses to filter the results based on the specified conditions:\n     - Filter for `probability.class_name = 'RRL'`\n     - Filter for `probability.probability > 0.55`\n     - Filter for `object.ndet >= 100`\n\n5. **Consider Sorting or Additional Output Formatting:**\n   - Although the user did not specify any sorting requirements, it may be beneficial to sort the results by `probability` in descending order to prioritize the most likely classifications.\n\n6. **Document the Query:**\n   - Prepare to write comments within the SQL code to clarify the purpose of each part of the query, especially the filtering conditions and the join operation.\n   - Create external documentation that outlines the query's purpose, the information it retrieves, and any assumptions made during the query formulation.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically construct a PostgreSQL query that meets the user's request for retrieving objects classified as RRL with the specified conditions.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

The user is interested in retrieving objects classified as RR Lyrae (RRL) by the light curve classifier, with specific conditions on probability and detection count. Here are the detailed steps to create the query:\n\n1. **Understand the Required Information:**\n   - The user wants to retrieve objects classified as 'RRL' (RR Lyrae) by the light curve classifier.\n   - The conditions specify that the probability of classification must be greater than 0.55.\n   - Additionally, the objects must have 100 or more detections.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Tables:**\n   - The primary tables involved are:\n     - `object`: This table contains the main statistics of the objects, including the number of detections (`ndet`).\n     - `probability`: This table contains the classification probabilities and rankings, including the class name (`class_name`), classifier name (`classifier_name`), and probability (`probability`).\n\n3. **Define the Selection Criteria:**\n   - From the `probability` table, we need to filter for:\n     - `class_name = 'RRL'`\n     - `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`\n     - `probability > 0.55`\n   - From the `object` table, we need to filter for:\n     - `ndet >= 100`\n\n4. **Formulate the Query Structure:**\n   - Start with a `SELECT` statement to retrieve all columns from the relevant tables.\n   - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `object` and `probability` tables based on the common key `oid` (object identifier).\n   - Apply the necessary `WHERE` clauses to filter the results based on the defined selection criteria.\n\n5. **Construct the Query:**\n   - The main table for the query will be `object`, and we will join it with the `probability` table.\n   - The `WHERE` clause will include conditions for both the `probability` table (for class and probability) and the `object` table (for the number of detections).\n\n6. **Document the Query:**\n   - Ensure that the query is well-commented to explain the purpose of each part, especially the filtering conditions and the join operation.\n   - Prepare external documentation that outlines the query's intent, the data it retrieves, and any assumptions made during its construction.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically create a PostgreSQL query that meets the user's request for retrieving objects classified as RRL with the specified conditions.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Query objects classified by the light curve classifier that are most likely to be RRL with a probability larger than 0.55 and that have 100 or more detections.

The goal is to retrieve probabilities for sources classified as AGN, QSO, or Blazar by the light curve classifier, while applying specific filters and conditions. Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown of the steps required to construct the query:\n\n1. **Understand the Requirements:**\n   - We need to retrieve probabilities for sources classified as AGN, QSO, or Blazar.\n   - The minimum number of detections (`ndet`) must be 40.\n   - The minimum time span between the first and last detection (`deltajd`) must be 200 days.\n   - Filter out sources with a predicted class probability higher than 0.8 for Blazar and 0.95 for AGN and QSO.\n   - The final output should include specific columns: `oid`, `meanra`, `meandec`, `ndet`, `firstmjd`, `deltajd`, `g_r_mean_corr`, `classifier_name`, `class_name`, `ranking`, and `probability`.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**\n   - The `probability` table contains the classification probabilities and rankings.\n   - The `object` table contains the main statistics of the objects, including `ndet`, `deltajd`, `meanra`, `meandec`, and `firstmjd`.\n\n3. **Define the Sub-Queries for Each Class:**\n   - Create a sub-query for each class (AGN, QSO, Blazar) to filter the relevant data:\n     - **For AGN:**\n       - Select from the `probability` table where `class_name = 'AGN'`, `ranking = 1`, and `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`.\n       - Join with the `object` table on `oid` to apply the conditions for `ndet` and `deltajd`.\n       - Filter for `probability > 0.95`.\n     - **For QSO:**\n       - Similar to AGN, but with `class_name = 'QSO'` and the same probability filter.\n     - **For Blazar:**\n       - Similar to AGN, but with `class_name = 'Blazar'` and filter for `probability > 0.8`.\n\n4. **Construct Each Sub-Query:**\n   - Each sub-query will:\n     - Select the required columns from both `probability` and `object` tables.\n     - Apply the necessary filters for `ndet`, `deltajd`, and probability thresholds.\n     - Ensure to include the `INNER JOIN` between `probability` and `object` on `oid`.\n\n5. **Combine Results Using UNION:**\n   - Use a `UNION` statement to combine the results of the three sub-queries. This will ensure that the final result set includes all relevant sources classified as AGN, QSO, or Blazar.\n\n6. **Final Output Specification:**\n   - Ensure that the final output includes the specified columns: `oid`, `meanra`, `meandec`, `ndet`, `firstmjd`, `deltajd`, `g_r_mean_corr`, `classifier_name`, `class_name`, `ranking`, and `probability`.\n   - The output should be distinct if necessary, depending on the nature of the data.\n\n7. **Document the Query:**\n   - Write comments within the SQL code to explain the purpose of each part of the query.\n   - Create external documentation that describes the query's purpose, the information it retrieves, and any assumptions or limitations.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically construct a PostgreSQL query that meets the user's requirements for retrieving probabilities for sources classified as AGN, QSO, or Blazar, while applying the necessary filters and conditions.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text.

The goal is to retrieve probabilities for sources classified as AGN, QSO, or Blazar by the light curve classifier, while applying specific filters and conditions. Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown of the steps required to construct the query:\n\n1. **Understand the Required Information:**\n   - We need to retrieve probabilities for sources classified as AGN, QSO, or Blazar.\n   - The required columns to return are: `oid`, `meanra`, `meandec`, `ndet`, `firstmjd`, `deltajd`, `g_r_mean_corr`, `classifier_name`, `class_name`, `ranking`, and `probability`.\n\n2. **Define the Selection Criteria:**\n   - Minimum number of detections (`ndet`) must be at least 40.\n   - Minimum time span between the first and last detection (`deltajd`) must be at least 200 days.\n   - Filter out sources with a predicted class probability higher than:\n     - 0.8 for the Blazar class\n     - 0.95 for the AGN and QSO classes\n\n3. **Identify Relevant Tables:**\n   - The `probability` table will be used to filter the classifications and probabilities.\n   - The `object` table will be used to retrieve the required object statistics (e.g., `meanra`, `meandec`, `ndet`, `firstmjd`, `deltajd`, `g_r_mean_corr`).\n\n4. **Create Sub-Queries for Each Class:**\n   - For each class (AGN, QSO, Blazar), create a sub-query that:\n     - Joins the `probability` table with the `object` table on the `oid` column.\n     - Applies the necessary filters for the class name, probability thresholds, and the conditions for `ndet` and `deltajd`.\n     - Selects the required columns from both tables.\n\n5. **Construct the Sub-Queries:**\n   - **Sub-query for AGN:**\n     - Filter for `class_name = 'AGN'` and `probability > 0.95`.\n   - **Sub-query for QSO:**\n     - Filter for `class_name = 'QSO'` and `probability > 0.95`.\n   - **Sub-query for Blazar:**\n     - Filter for `class_name = 'Blazar'` and `probability > 0.8`.\n\n6. **Combine Sub-Queries Using UNION:**\n   - Use a `UNION` statement to combine the results of the three sub-queries. This will ensure that the final result set includes all relevant sources classified under any of the three classes.\n\n7. **Final Selection and Ordering:**\n   - Ensure that the final result set includes all specified columns.\n   - Optionally, apply an `ORDER BY` clause if a specific sorting order is desired (e.g., by `probability` or `oid`).\n\n8. **Document the Query:**\n   - Write comments within the SQL code to explain the purpose of each part of the query.\n   - Create external documentation that describes the query's purpose, the information it retrieves, and any assumptions or limitations.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically construct a PostgreSQL query that meets the user's requirements while ensuring optimal performance and accuracy.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Write a script in PostgreSQL with a query asking for all the probabilities for all the sources classfied as either AGN, QSO or Blazar by the light curve classifier.

Also, filter out sources using a predicted class probability higher than 0.8 for the Blazar class and 0.95 for the AGN and QSO classes. Collect similar numbers for each class using a UNION statement between each sub-query defined by each probability.

Here are the detailed steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Tables:**\n   - The main tables involved are `object`, `probability`, and `feature`.\n   - The `object` table contains the main statistics of the objects, including their identifiers and detection times.\n   - The `probability` table contains classification probabilities and rankings for each object.\n   - The `feature` table contains various features associated with each object.\n\n2. **Define the Query Requirements:**\n   - We need to filter objects based on the following criteria:\n     - First detection occurred in July 2023 (between mjd 60126.0 and 60156.0).\n     - Objects must be within a search radius of 1000 arcmin (which is approximately 16.16667 degrees) from the center of the Abell 370 galaxy cluster (RA=39.97, Dec=-1.5768).\n     - The `sgscore1` feature must be less than 0.3.\n     - The highest probability in the `stamp_classifier` should not be for the classes 'Asteroid' or 'Bogus'.\n   - The required output columns are: `oid`, `value`, `name`, `version`, `meanra`, `meandec`, and the calculated distance as 'dist'.\n\n3. **Create a Sub-query for Object Filtering:**\n   - Start by creating a sub-query to filter objects based on the first detection date. This will involve selecting from the `object` table where `firstmjd` is between 60126.0 and 60156.0.\n   - This sub-query will return the `oid` of the objects that meet the date criteria.\n\n4. **Spatial Filtering Using Q3C Functions:**\n   - Use the `q3c_radial_query` function to filter objects based on their celestial coordinates. This will involve joining the `object` table with the results of the previous sub-query to ensure that only objects within the specified radius from the Abell 370 cluster are included.\n   - The condition will be: `q3c_radial_query(meanra, meandec, 39.97, -1.5768, 16.16667)`.\n\n5. **Filter by sgscore1 Feature:**\n   - Create a sub-query to filter the `feature` table for the `sgscore1` feature where `value < 0.3`. This will involve an INNER JOIN with the `object` table to ensure that only features associated with the filtered objects are included.\n   - This sub-query will return the `oid` of objects that meet the `sgscore1` condition.\n\n6. **Filter by Probability Conditions:**\n   - Create another sub-query to filter the `probability` table for the highest probability in the `stamp_classifier`. This will involve selecting from the `probability` table where `ranking = 1` and `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`.\n   - Additionally, filter out objects where the `class_name` is either 'Asteroid' or 'Bogus'. This can be done using a NOT IN clause or a LEFT JOIN with a condition to exclude these classes.\n\n7. **Combine Filters Using INTERSECT:**\n   - Use an INTERSECT operation to combine the results of the `sgscore1` sub-query and the `probability` sub-query. This will ensure that only objects that meet all the specified conditions are included.\n\n8. **Final Selection of Columns:**\n   - After obtaining the filtered list of `oid`s, perform a final selection from the `object` table to retrieve the required columns: `oid`, `meanra`, `meandec`.\n   - Additionally, join with the `feature` table to get the `value`, `name`, and `version` for the `sgscore1` feature.\n\n9. **Calculate Distance:**\n   - Use the `q3c_dist` function to calculate the distance from the center of the Abell 370 galaxy cluster for each object. This will be included in the final SELECT statement as 'dist'.\n\n10. **Construct the Final Query:**\n    - Combine all the components into a final query that selects the required columns, applies all the filters, and calculates the distance.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically construct the PostgreSQL query to retrieve the desired information from the ALeRCE database. Each step ensures that we adhere to the specified conditions and utilize the appropriate tables and functions effectively.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: -- mjd date for the start of July = 60126.0\n-- mjd date for the end of July = 60156.0\nDomain Knowledge: -- 1000 arcmin = 16.16667 degrees\n\n # User Request: ''Get the object identifiers that had their first detection in July 2023, are within a search radius of 1000 arcmin from the center of the Abell 370 galaxy cluster (centered at RA=39.97, Dec=-1.5768), have sgscore1<0.3 and their highest probability in the stamp classifier is not obtained for class Asteroid nor class Bogus.

If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nTo generate the required PostgreSQL query for retrieving the specified information from the ALeRCE database, we will follow a systematic decomposition plan. Here are the detailed steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Tables and Columns:**\n   - The main tables involved are `object`, `probability`, and `feature`.\n   - Relevant columns from the `object` table include `oid`, `meanra`, and `meandec`.\n   - From the `probability` table, we need `oid`, `class_name`, and `ranking`.\n   - From the `feature` table, we need `oid`, `name`, `value`, and `version`.\n\n2. **Define the Date Range for First Detection:**\n   - We need to filter objects that had their first detection in July 2023, which corresponds to the MJD range of 60126.0 to 60156.0. This will be used in the `WHERE` clause of the query.\n\n3. **Calculate the Search Radius:**\n   - Convert the search radius from arcminutes to degrees. Given that 1000 arcmin equals approximately 16.16667 degrees, we will use this value in the spatial query.\n\n4. **Set Up the Spatial Query:**\n   - Use the Q3C function `q3c_radial_query` to filter objects based on their coordinates. The center of the Abell 370 galaxy cluster is given as RA=39.97 and Dec=-1.5768. The query will check if the objects are within 16.16667 degrees of this center.\n\n5. **Filter by sgscore1 Value:**\n   - We need to filter the results to include only those objects where `sgscore1 < 0.3`. This will be done using a condition in the `WHERE` clause.\n\n6. **Sub-query for Probability Filtering:**\n   - Create a sub-query to filter the `probability` table to get the most likely probabilities for each object. This sub-query will:\n     - Filter for `ranking = 1` and `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`.\n     - Exclude objects where `class_name` is 'Asteroid' or 'Bogus'.\n\n7. **Join the Probability Sub-query with Object Table:**\n   - Perform an `INNER JOIN` between the `object` table and the filtered `probability` sub-query to ensure we only get objects that meet the probability criteria.\n\n8. **Sub-query for Feature Retrieval:**\n   - Create a sub-query to retrieve features from the `feature` table. This sub-query will:\n     - Filter for the specific features of interest (e.g., `sgscore1`).\n     - Join with the `probability` sub-query to ensure we only get features associated with the filtered objects.\n\n9. **Select Required Columns:**\n   - In the final selection, include the columns `oid`, `value`, `name`, `version`, `meanra`, `meandec`, and the calculated distance using the `q3c_dist` function. The distance will be calculated between the object's coordinates and the center of the Abell 370 galaxy cluster.\n\n10. **Final Query Construction:**\n    - Combine all the components into a single query that:\n      - Filters objects based on the first detection date, spatial proximity, `sgscore1` value, and probability conditions.\n      - Joins the necessary tables to retrieve the required columns.\n      - Calculates the distance using the `q3c_dist` function and aliases it as 'dist'.\n\n11. **Testing and Validation:**\n    - After constructing the query, it should be tested to ensure it returns the expected results and adheres to the specified conditions.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically construct the PostgreSQL query to retrieve the desired information from the ALeRCE database.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: -- mjd date for the start of July = 60126.0\n-- mjd date for the end of July = 60156.0\nDomain Knowledge: -- 1000 arcmin = 16.16667 degrees\n\n # User Request: ''Get the object identifiers that had their first detection in July 2023, are within a search radius of 1000 arcmin from the center of the Abell 370 galaxy cluster (centered at RA=39.97, Dec=-1.5768), have sgscore1<0.3 and their highest probability in the stamp classifier is not obtained for class Asteroid nor class Bogus.

The goal is to retrieve specific information about astronomical objects classified as 'SN II' with certain conditions. Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown of the steps required to construct the query:\n\n1. **Understand the Required Information:**\n   - We need to retrieve the following columns:\n     - Object identifier (`oid`) from the `object` table.\n     - Candidate identifier (`candid`) from the `detection` table.\n     - Name and value of the feature from the `feature` table.\n     - PSF magnitudes (`magpsf`) and magnitude errors (`sigmapsf`) from the `detection` table.\n     - Band identifiers (`fid`) from the `detection` table, which will be renamed to `feature_fid`.\n\n2. **Define the Conditions:**\n   - The objects must be classified as 'SN II'.\n   - The probability of classification must be greater than 0.6.\n   - The number of detections (`ndet`) must be greater than 50.\n   - The difference between the minimum and maximum magnitudes in the ZTF g-band (`delta_mag_fid` for fid=1) must be greater than 2 mag.\n\n3. **Identify Relevant Tables:**\n   - The main tables involved are:\n     - `object`: for object identifiers and their statistics.\n     - `probability`: for classification probabilities and class names.\n     - `detection`: for detection details including candidate identifiers and magnitudes.\n     - `feature`: for features associated with the objects.\n\n4. **Create a Subquery for Object Classification:**\n   - Start by creating a subquery that filters the `probability` table to select `oid` for objects classified as 'SN II' with a probability greater than 0.6. This subquery will also ensure that we only consider the most likely classification by applying the condition `ranking = 1` and `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`.\n\n5. **Join with the Object Table:**\n   - Use an INNER JOIN between the `object` table and the subquery from step 4 to filter the objects based on the classification criteria.\n\n6. **Filter Based on Detection Criteria:**\n   - Apply a condition to filter the results where the number of detections (`ndet`) is greater than 50. This can be done directly on the `object` table.\n\n7. **Join with the Detection Table:**\n   - Perform an INNER JOIN with the `detection` table to retrieve the candidate identifiers (`candid`), PSF magnitudes (`magpsf`), magnitude errors (`sigmapsf`), and band identifiers (`fid`).\n\n8. **Filter for Magnitude Difference in g-band:**\n   - Use a subquery or a CTE (Common Table Expression) to calculate the difference between the minimum and maximum magnitudes in the g-band (where `fid = 1`). This will involve aggregating the `detection` table to find the minimum and maximum magnitudes for each `oid` and filtering for those where the difference is greater than 2.\n\n9. **Join with the Feature Table:**\n   - Perform an INNER JOIN with the `feature` table to retrieve the name and value of the features associated with the selected objects. Ensure to include the condition that the features are linked to the correct `oid`.\n\n10. **Select and Rename Columns:**\n    - In the final SELECT statement, retrieve the required columns: `oid`, `candid`, feature name, feature value, `magpsf`, `sigmapsf`, and `fid`. Rename the `fid` column to `feature_fid` as specified.\n\n11. **Order the Results:**\n    - Finally, apply an `ORDER BY` clause to sort the results by `oid`.\n\n12. **Document the Query:**\n    - Write comments within the SQL code to explain the purpose of different parts of the query and create external documentation that describes the query's purpose, the information it retrieves, and any assumptions or limitations.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically construct a PostgreSQL query that meets the user's request while ensuring optimal performance and accuracy.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Get the object identifier, candidate identifier of the detections, name and value of the feature, psf magnitudes, magnitude errors, and band identifiers renaming the feature fid column as 'feature_fid', as a function of time of the objects classified as SN II with probability larger than 0.6, number of detections greater than 50 and difference between minimum and maximum magnitudes in ZTF g-band greater than 2 mag.

The goal is to retrieve specific information about astronomical objects classified as SN II with certain conditions. Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown of the steps required to construct the query:\n\n1. **Understand the Requirements:**\n   - We need to retrieve the following columns:\n     - Object identifier (`oid`)\n     - Candidate identifier of the detections (`candid`)\n     - Name and value of the feature (`name`, `value`)\n     - PSF magnitudes (`magpsf`)\n     - Magnitude errors (`sigmapsf`)\n     - Band identifiers (`fid`)\n   - The feature column `fid` should be renamed to `feature_fid`.\n   - The conditions for filtering the results are:\n     - Objects classified as 'SNII' with a probability greater than 0.6.\n     - Number of detections (`ndet`) greater than 50.\n     - Difference between minimum and maximum magnitudes in the ZTF g-band (`delta_mag_fid`) greater than 2 mag.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Tables:**\n   - The `object` table contains the main statistics of the objects.\n   - The `probability` table contains classification probabilities and rankings.\n   - The `feature` table contains features associated with the objects.\n   - The `detection` table contains information about the detections, including PSF magnitudes and errors.\n\n3. **Formulate the Query Requirements:**\n   - Start by filtering the `probability` table to get the `oid` of objects classified as 'SNII' with a probability greater than 0.6 and ranking = 1.\n   - Join this filtered result with the `object` table to apply additional conditions on the number of detections and the difference in magnitudes.\n   - Join the result with the `feature` table to get the feature names and values.\n   - Finally, join with the `detection` table to retrieve the PSF magnitudes and errors.\n\n4. **Design the Query:**\n   - **Step 1:** Create a sub-query to filter the `probability` table for objects classified as 'SNII' with a probability greater than 0.6 and ranking = 1.\n   - **Step 2:** Use an `INNER JOIN` to connect the result of Step 1 with the `object` table, applying the conditions:\n     - `ndet > 50`\n     - `delta_mag_fid > 2` (this will require a sub-query or a direct reference to the `feature` table to get the `delta_mag_fid` for the g-band).\n   - **Step 3:** Create a sub-query to filter the `feature` table for the specific features needed (e.g., `delta_mag_fid` for the g-band) and join it with the result from Step 2.\n   - **Step 4:** Join the result from Step 3 with the `detection` table to get the `candid`, `magpsf`, and `sigmapsf`.\n   - **Step 5:** Select the required columns, ensuring to rename the `fid` column to `feature_fid`.\n   - **Step 6:** Order the final results by `oid`.\n\n5. **Document the Query:**\n   - Write comments within the SQL code to explain the purpose of different parts of the query.\n   - Create external documentation that describes the query's purpose, the information it retrieves, and any assumptions or limitations.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically construct a PostgreSQL query that meets the user's request while ensuring optimal performance and accuracy based on the ALeRCE database schema.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Get the object identifier, candidate identifier of the detections, name and value of the feature, psf magnitudes, magnitude errors, and band identifiers renaming the feature fid column as 'feature_fid', as a function of time of the objects classified as SN II with probability larger than 0.6, number of detections greater than 50 and difference between minimum and maximum magnitudes in ZTF g-band greater than 2 mag.

The steps are outlined below:\n\n1. **Understand the Requirements:**\n   - The user wants to retrieve objects classified as Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) with a probability greater than 0.7.\n   - The objects must also exhibit periodicities, specifically with a photometric period between 3 to 10 days and a variation amplitude greater than 0.5 mag.\n   - The results should be sorted by probability in descending order and should include specific columns: object identifier, probability, feature value, feature name, filter ID, and feature version.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Tables:**\n   - The `probability` table will be used to filter for YSOs and their probabilities.\n   - The `feature` table will be used to retrieve features related to periodicity, specifically the photometric period and variation amplitude.\n   - The `object` table may be used to link the features and probabilities to the object identifiers.\n\n3. **Set Default Conditions:**\n   - Apply the default conditions for the `probability` table:\n     - `probability.ranking = 1` (to get the most likely class).\n     - `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`.\n   - Filter for YSOs specifically:\n     - `probability.class_name = 'YSO'`.\n   - Set the probability condition:\n     - `probability.probability > 0.7`.\n\n4. **Create Sub-Query for Probability:**\n   - Construct a sub-query to select the `oid` (object identifier) from the `probability` table that meets the above conditions. This sub-query will be used to filter the `feature` table.\n\n5. **Identify Features for Periodicity:**\n   - Determine the specific features that correspond to photometric period and variation amplitude:\n     - For photometric period, identify the feature name (e.g., `Period_band`).\n     - For variation amplitude, identify the feature name (e.g., `Amplitude`).\n   - Create sub-queries for each feature to filter based on the specified conditions:\n     - For the photometric period, filter for values between 3 and 10 days.\n     - For the variation amplitude, filter for values greater than 0.5 mag.\n\n6. **Join Features with Probability:**\n   - Use INNER JOINs to connect the `feature` table with the sub-query from the `probability` table based on the `oid`.\n   - Ensure that the conditions for the features are applied correctly in the JOINs.\n\n7. **Combine Feature Queries:**\n   - Use UNION to combine the results of the sub-queries for the periodicity features (photometric period and variation amplitude).\n   - Use INTERSECT to find common `oids` that meet both feature conditions.\n\n8. **Filter Final Results:**\n   - Filter the results from the UNION query to include only those `oids` that are also present in the INTERSECT query.\n   - Join this filtered result back to the `probability` sub-query to include the probability information.\n\n9. **Select Required Columns:**\n   - From the final result set, select the required columns: `oid`, `probability`, `value`, `name`, `fid`, and `version` from the `feature` table.\n\n10. **Sort the Results:**\n    - Apply an ORDER BY clause to sort the results by `probability` in descending order.\n\n11. **Document the Query:**\n    - Write comments within the SQL code to explain the purpose of different parts of the query.\n    - Create external documentation that describes the query's purpose, the information it retrieves, and any assumptions or limitations.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically construct a PostgreSQL query that meets the user's request for retrieving objects likely to be YSOs with specific periodicity characteristics from the ALeRCE database.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

The steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Understand the Requirements:**\n   - The user wants to retrieve objects classified as Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) with a probability greater than 0.7.\n   - The objects should exhibit periodicities, specifically a photometric period between 3 to 10 days and a variation amplitude greater than 0.5 mag.\n   - The results should be sorted by probability in descending order.\n   - The output should include the object identifier, probability, feature value, feature name, filter ID, and feature version.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Tables:**\n   - The `probability` table will be used to filter for YSOs and their probabilities.\n   - The `feature` table will be used to retrieve features related to the periodicities (specifically the photometric period and variation amplitude).\n   - The `object` table may be used to link the features and probabilities to the object identifiers.\n\n3. **Define the Selection Criteria:**\n   - From the `probability` table:\n     - Filter for `class_name = 'YSO'`.\n     - Filter for `probability > 0.7`.\n   - From the `feature` table:\n     - Identify features related to photometric period and variation amplitude.\n     - Specifically, filter for:\n       - `name = 'Period_band'` with `value BETWEEN 3 AND 10`.\n       - `name = 'Amplitude'` with `value > 0.5`.\n\n4. **Create Sub-Queries:**\n   - **Sub-query for Probability:**\n     - Create a sub-query that selects `oid` from the `probability` table where `class_name = 'YSO'` and `probability > 0.7`.\n   - **Sub-query for Features:**\n     - Create a sub-query for the `Period_band` feature that selects `oid` where `name = 'Period_band'` and `value BETWEEN 3 AND 10`, joining with the probability sub-query to ensure only relevant objects are included.\n     - Create a sub-query for the `Amplitude` feature that selects `oid` where `name = 'Amplitude'` and `value > 0.5`, also joining with the probability sub-query.\n\n5. **Combine Feature Sub-Queries:**\n   - Use an `INTERSECT` to find `oids` that are present in both the `Period_band` and `Amplitude` sub-queries. This ensures that only objects meeting both feature criteria are selected.\n\n6. **Final Selection:**\n   - Use the results from the `INTERSECT` to filter the original probability sub-query, ensuring that only objects that are classified as YSOs with a probability greater than 0.7 and that also meet the periodicity criteria are included.\n   - Join the `object` table to retrieve the object identifiers and any additional information needed.\n\n7. **Select Required Columns:**\n   - From the final result set, select the following columns:\n     - `oid` (object identifier)\n     - `probability` (from the probability table)\n     - `value` (from the feature table)\n     - `name` (from the feature table)\n     - `fid` (filter ID from the feature table)\n     - `version` (feature version from the feature table)\n\n8. **Sort the Results:**\n   - Apply an `ORDER BY` clause to sort the results by `probability` in descending order.\n\n9. **Document the Query:**\n   - Ensure that comments are included in the SQL code to explain the purpose of each part of the query, and create external documentation that describes the query's purpose and any assumptions made.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically construct a PostgreSQL query that meets the user's request for retrieving objects likely to be YSOs with specific periodicity characteristics from the ALeRCE database.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Get objects that are likely to be YSOs (possibility great than 0.7) and with some periodicities.

Here are the detailed steps required to construct the query:\n\n1. **Understand the Requirements:**\n   - We need to retrieve two distinct groups of objects: AGN and QSO.\n   - Each group must meet specific probability thresholds: AGN must have a probability greater than 0.6, and QSO must have a probability greater than 0.5.\n   - We need to limit the results to the top 1000 objects for each category based on their probability in descending order.\n   - Additionally, both groups must have between 30 and 200 detections.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**\n   - The `probability` table will be used to filter objects based on their classification and probability.\n   - The `object` table will be used to filter based on the number of detections.\n   - Relevant columns:\n     - From `probability`: `oid`, `class_name`, `probability`, `ranking`, `classifier_name`.\n     - From `object`: `oid`, `ndet`.\n\n3. **Formulate the Subquery for AGN:**\n   - Create a subquery to select AGN candidates from the `probability` table:\n     - Filter for `class_name = 'AGN'`.\n     - Apply the condition `probability > 0.6`.\n     - Ensure to select only the top 1000 entries ordered by `probability` in descending order.\n   - This subquery will return the `oid` of AGN candidates.\n\n4. **Formulate the Subquery for QSO:**\n   - Similarly, create a subquery to select QSO candidates from the `probability` table:\n     - Filter for `class_name = 'QSO'`.\n     - Apply the condition `probability > 0.5`.\n     - Ensure to select only the top 1000 entries ordered by `probability` in descending order.\n   - This subquery will return the `oid` of QSO candidates.\n\n5. **Join with the Object Table:**\n   - For both AGN and QSO subqueries, perform an `INNER JOIN` with the `object` table to filter based on the number of detections:\n     - Use the condition `ndet BETWEEN 30 AND 200` to ensure that only objects with the specified number of detections are included.\n\n6. **Combine Results:**\n   - Use a `UNION` to combine the results of the AGN and QSO queries. This will create a single result set containing both types of objects that meet the specified criteria.\n\n7. **Final Selection:**\n   - Select all relevant columns from the combined result set. Since the user did not specify particular columns, we can use `SELECT *` to retrieve all columns from the resulting dataset.\n\n8. **Order the Final Results:**\n   - Ensure that the final results are ordered by probability in descending order.

This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text.

Here are the detailed steps required to construct the query:\n\n1. **Understand the Requirements:**\n   - We need to retrieve two distinct groups of objects: AGN and QSO.\n   - Each group must meet specific probability thresholds: AGN must have a probability greater than 0.6, and QSO must have a probability greater than 0.5.\n   - We need to limit the results to the top 1000 objects for each category, ordered by their probability in descending order.\n   - Additionally, both groups must have between 30 and 200 detections.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**\n   - The `probability` table will be used to filter objects based on their classification and probability.\n   - The `object` table will be used to filter based on the number of detections.\n   - Relevant columns:\n     - From `probability`: `oid`, `class_name`, `probability`, `ranking`, `classifier_name`.\n     - From `object`: `oid`, `ndet`.\n\n3. **Formulate the Subqueries for Each Class:**\n   - **For AGN:**\n     - Create a subquery to select AGN from the `probability` table where:\n       - `class_name = 'AGN'`\n       - `probability > 0.6`\n       - `ranking = 1` (to ensure we are only considering the most likely classification).\n     - Join this subquery with the `object` table to filter for objects with `ndet` between 30 and 200.\n     - Use `ORDER BY probability DESC` to sort the results and limit the output to the top 1000 entries.\n\n   - **For QSO:**\n     - Similarly, create a subquery to select QSO from the `probability` table where:\n       - `class_name = 'QSO'`\n       - `probability > 0.5`\n       - `ranking = 1`.\n     - Join this subquery with the `object` table to filter for objects with `ndet` between 30 and 200.\n     - Again, use `ORDER BY probability DESC` to sort the results and limit the output to the top 1000 entries.\n\n4. **Combine Results:**\n   - Use a `UNION` statement to combine the results from the AGN and QSO subqueries. This will create a single result set containing both types of objects.\n\n5. **Final Selection:**\n   - Ensure that the final output includes all relevant columns from both the `probability` and `object` tables. This may involve selecting specific columns or using `SELECT *` to include all columns.\n\n6. **Document the Query:**\n   - Write comments within the SQL code to explain the purpose of each part of the query, especially the filtering conditions and the rationale for using `UNION`.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically construct a PostgreSQL query that meets the user's request for retrieving the top AGN and QSO candidates based on the specified criteria.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Query the top 1000 active galactic nuclei and top 1000 quasi\u2013stellar objects candidates ordered by probability in descending order, that have a probability > 0.6 and 0.5 respectively according to the light curve classifier.

This function will be applied to the `meanra` and `meandec` columns of the `object` table.\n\n5. **Set Up Temporal Query Conditions:**\n   - Filter the results based on the `firstmjd` column to ensure that only objects with their first detection between MJD 59976.0 and MJD 59982.0 are included in the results.\n\n6. **Combine Conditions:**\n   - Combine the spatial and temporal conditions using a `WHERE` clause. This will ensure that the query retrieves only those objects that meet both the spatial proximity and the temporal detection criteria.\n\n7. **Select Required Columns:**\n   - Since the user did not specify particular columns, use `SELECT *` to retrieve all columns from the `object` table for the matching records.\n\n8. **Document the Query Logic:**\n   - Write comments within the SQL code to explain the purpose of each part of the query, including the use of the temporary table for coordinates, the spatial filtering, and the temporal filtering.\n\n9. **Test the Query:**\n   - After constructing the query, it is important to test it to ensure it performs as expected and returns accurate results based on the specified conditions.\n\nBy following these steps, you will be able to construct a PostgreSQL query that accurately retrieves the desired information from the ALeRCE database based on the user's request.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n# If you need to use 2 tables, try using a INNER JOIN statement, or a sub-query over 'probability' or 'object', if the query requires it.

If you want to add comments, use the SQL comment format inside the query.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nTo generate a PostgreSQL query based on the user request, follow these detailed steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Required Information:**\n   - The user wants to retrieve information about astronomical objects that are within 10 degrees of two specified celestial coordinates (RA and Dec) for two sources: \n     - Source 1: (160.18301441363647, 33.0164673528409)\n     - Source 2: (174.21524897555543, 44.83789535222221)\n   - Additionally, the objects must have their first detection within the first 7 days of February (from MJD 59976.0 to MJD 59982.0).\n\n2. **Define the Temporary Catalog Table:**\n   - Create a temporary inline table using a `WITH` clause to define the two sources with their respective coordinates. This will allow for easy reference in the spatial query.\n\n3. **Use Q3C Functions for Spatial Query:**\n   - Utilize the `q3c_radial_query` function to filter objects based on their celestial coordinates. This function will check if the objects' coordinates fall within a 10-degree radius of the specified coordinates for both sources.\n\n4. **Select the Main Table:**\n   - The main table to query is the `object` table, which contains the necessary information about the astronomical objects.\n\n5. **Apply Filtering Conditions:**\n   - Add a `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the following conditions:\n     - The `firstmjd` (time of first detection) must be greater than or equal to 59976.0 (February 1) and less than or equal to 59982.0 (February 7).\n     - Use the `q3c_radial_query` function to check if the mean right ascension (`meanra`) and mean declination (`meandec`) of the objects are within 10 degrees of the coordinates defined in the temporary catalog.\n\n6. **Combine Conditions for Both Sources:**\n   - Since there are two sources, the query should ensure that the spatial condition is satisfied for either of the two sources. This can be done using an `OR` condition in the `WHERE` clause.\n\n7. **Select All Relevant Columns:**\n   - Since the user did not specify particular columns, use `SELECT *` to retrieve all columns from the `object` table that meet the specified conditions.\n\n8. **Document the Query:**\n   - Prepare comments within the SQL code to explain the purpose of each part of the query, including the temporary table creation, spatial filtering, and date filtering.\n\nBy following these steps, you will be able to construct a PostgreSQL query that accurately retrieves the desired information from the ALeRCE database based on the user's request.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: \n-- mjd date for February 01 = 59976.0\n-- mjd date for February 07 = 59982.0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Return a query from ('source_1', 160.18301441363647, 33.0164673528409),\n('source_2', 174.21524897555543, 44.83789535222221) for object within 10 degress of the given positions, and with their first detection the first 7 days of February''"}], "max_tokens": 4000, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "n": 1}}

The MJD for February 1, 2023, is 59976.0, and for February 2, 2023, it is 59977.0. This means we want to filter objects where `firstmjd` is between 59976.0 and 59977.0.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Tables:**\n   - The main tables involved are `object` (for object identifiers and galactic coordinates) and `probability` (for class names and classifications).\n   - The `feature` table will be used to retrieve specific feature columns associated with the objects.\n\n3. **Set Up the Main Query:**\n   - Start with the `object` table to retrieve the necessary columns: `meanra`, `meandec`, and `oid`.\n   - Apply a `WHERE` clause to filter objects based on the `firstmjd` condition (between 59976.0 and 59977.0).\n\n4. **Create a Subquery for Classifications:**\n   - Create a subquery that selects `oid` from the `probability` table where:\n     - `ranking` = 1 (to get the most likely class),\n     - `classifier_name` = 'lc_classifier' (to filter for the light curve classifier).\n   - This subquery will be used to filter the objects in the main query.\n\n5. **Join the Subquery with the Object Table:**\n   - Use an `INNER JOIN` between the `object` table and the subquery from step 4 to ensure that only objects classified by the light curve classifier are included in the results.\n\n6. **Retrieve Feature Columns:**\n   - For each feature of interest, create a subquery that retrieves the specific features from the `feature` table. This will involve:\n     - Filtering by `oid` from the results of the previous join.\n     - Selecting the desired feature columns (e.g., `Amplitude`, `Std`, etc.) based on the features you want to include in the final output.\n   - Each feature subquery should be structured to return the `oid`, `name`, and `value` of the features.\n\n7. **Combine Feature Subqueries:**\n   - Use `UNION` to combine the results of the feature subqueries if multiple features are being retrieved. This will create a unified list of features associated with the objects.\n\n8. **Integrate Features with Main Query:**\n   - Use an `INNER JOIN` or a `LEFT JOIN` to combine the results of the feature subquery (from step 7) with the main query results (from step 5). This will allow you to include the feature data alongside the object identifiers and galactic coordinates.\n\n9. **Select Final Output:**\n   - In the final `SELECT` statement, include the columns for galactic coordinates (`meanra`, `meandec`), the `oid`, and the feature columns retrieved from the feature subquery.\n   - Ensure that the class name from the `probability` table is also included in the final output.\n\n10. **Document the Query:**\n    - Write comments within the SQL code to explain the purpose of different parts of the query, especially the filtering conditions and joins.\n    - Create external documentation that describes the query's purpose, the information it retrieves, and any assumptions or limitations.\n\nBy following these steps, you will systematically construct a PostgreSQL query that meets the user's request for retrieving the specified information from the ALeRCE database.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

The goal is to retrieve the galactic coordinates, feature columns, class name, and identifiers of objects classified by the light curve classifier that were first detected between February 1 and 2 of 2023. Here are the detailed steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Date Range:**\n   - Convert the specified dates into Modified Julian Dates (MJD):\n     - February 1, 2023 = 59976.0\n     - February 2, 2023 = 59977.0\n   - The query should filter objects with `firstmjd` between 59976.0 and 59977.0 (inclusive).\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Tables:**\n   - The main tables involved are:\n     - `object`: Contains the main statistics of the objects, including `firstmjd`, `meanra`, `meandec`, `gal_l`, and `gal_b`.\n     - `probability`: Contains classification information, including `oid`, `class_name`, and `classifier_name`.\n     - `feature`: Contains various features associated with each object.\n\n3. **Set Default Conditions for the Probability Table:**\n   - Since the user is interested in objects classified by the light curve classifier, we will apply the following conditions:\n     - `probability.ranking = 1` (to get the most likely classification).\n     - `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`.\n\n4. **Create a Sub-query for the Probability Table:**\n   - Construct a sub-query to select `oid` from the `probability` table where the conditions from step 3 are met. This sub-query will be used to filter the objects in the main query.\n\n5. **Join the Object Table:**\n   - Use an INNER JOIN between the `object` table and the sub-query from step 4 to filter the objects based on their identifiers (`oid`) and the date range specified in step 1. This will ensure that we only retrieve objects that were first detected within the specified date range.\n\n6. **Select Required Columns:**\n   - From the joined result, select the following columns:\n     - `gal_l` (Galactic longitude).\n     - `gal_b` (Galactic latitude).\n     - All relevant feature columns from the `feature` table.\n     - `class_name` from the `probability` table.\n     - `oid` from the `object` table.\n\n7. **Handle Feature Columns:**\n   - Since the `feature` table is transposed (each feature is in a different row), we need to retrieve the features associated with the selected objects:\n     - Create a sub-query to select features from the `feature` table where the `oid` matches those from the previous join.\n     - Use an INNER JOIN to ensure that only features related to the selected objects are included.\n\n8. **Aggregate Feature Data:**\n   - If multiple features are retrieved, consider how to aggregate or present them. This may involve using GROUP BY or other aggregation functions if necessary, depending on how the features should be displayed.\n\n9. **Combine Results:**\n   - Ensure that the final result set includes all the required columns from the `object`, `probability`, and `feature` tables, ensuring that the data is correctly aligned.\n\n10. **Final Query Construction:**\n    - Combine all the components into a final SQL query that adheres to the structure outlined above, ensuring that all conditions and joins are correctly applied.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically construct a PostgreSQL query that retrieves the desired information from the ALeRCE database while adhering to the specified conditions and requirements.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: \n-- mjd date for February 1 2023 = 59976.0\n-- mjd date for February 3 2023 = 59978.0\nDomain Knowledge: \n-- The galactic coordinate system locates objects within the Milky Way galaxy by 'latitude' and 'longitude'\n # User Request: ''Write a query in SQL that returns the galactic coordinates, feature columns, class name, and the identifiers of the objects classified by the light curve classifier that were first detected between February 1 and 2 of 2023.''"}], "max_tokens": 4000, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "n": 1}}

This subquery will return the `oid` of the relevant objects.\n\n5. **Join with the Object Table:**\n   - Use an INNER JOIN between the `object` table and the subquery from step 4 to retrieve the relevant object details.

This subquery should filter for:\n     - `oid` in the list of `oids` from the previous subquery\n     - `fid` values corresponding to g-band (1) and r-band (2)\n     - Ensure to include the conditions for the initial rise rate and the number of detections:\n       - `magpsf` and `sigmapsf` for g and r bands\n       - Calculate the initial rise rate based on the available detections.\n\n7. **Aggregate and Filter Detections:**\n   - Use aggregation functions to ensure that:\n     - The number of observations in the r-band is at least 100 days.\n     - The total number of detections is greater than 30.\n   - This may involve using `GROUP BY` on `oid` and applying `HAVING` clauses to enforce these conditions.\n\n8. **Select Required Columns:**\n   - From the final result set, select the required columns:\n     - `oid`\n     - `candid`\n     - Magnitudes and magnitude errors from the `detection` table\n     - Rename the `fid` column to `f_id` in the final output.\n\n9. **Order the Results:**\n   - Optionally, specify an `ORDER BY` clause to sort the results based on a relevant criterion, such as `firstmjd` or `lastmjd`.\n\n10. **Document the Query:**\n    - Write comments within the SQL code to explain the purpose of different parts of the query.\n    - Create external documentation that describes the query's purpose, the information it retrieves, and any assumptions or limitations.\n\nBy following these steps, you will systematically build a PostgreSQL query that meets the user's request while adhering to the specified conditions and database schema.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

The goal is to retrieve sources classified as AGN, QSO, or Blazar by the ALeRCE light curve classifier, while applying specific filters. Here are the detailed steps required to construct the query:\n\n1. **Understand the Required Information:**\n   - The user wants to retrieve sources classified as AGN, QSO, or Blazar.\n   - The sources must have a minimum number of detections of 30.\n   - The time span between the first and last detection must be at least 200 days.\n   - The predicted class probability must be higher than 0.5.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**\n   - The `object` table contains the main statistics of the sources, including:\n     - `ndet` (total number of detections)\n     - `firstmjd` (time of first detection)\n     - `lastmjd` (time of last detection)\n   - The `probability` table contains classification probabilities and rankings, including:\n     - `class_name` (the name of the class, which will be filtered for AGN, QSO, and Blazar)\n     - `probability` (the predicted probability of the class)\n     - `ranking` (to ensure we only get the most likely classification)\n     - `classifier_name` (to ensure we are using the light curve classifier)\n\n3. **Define the Query Requirements:**\n   - We will need to join the `object` table and the `probability` table based on the `oid` (object identifier).\n   - Apply filters based on the user's criteria:\n     - `ndet >= 30` (minimum number of detections)\n     - `lastmjd - firstmjd >= 200` (minimum time span)\n     - `probability > 0.5` (predicted class probability)\n     - `ranking = 1` (to get the most likely classification)\n     - `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'` (to ensure we are using the correct classifier)\n     - `class_name` must be one of ('AGN', 'QSO', 'Blazar').\n\n4. **Design the Query:**\n   - Start with a `SELECT` statement to retrieve all columns from the `object` table and the relevant columns from the `probability` table.\n   - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `object` and `probability` tables on the `oid` column.\n   - Apply the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the defined criteria.\n   - Ensure that the conditions for filtering the `probability` table are included as specified in the general context.\n\n5. **Document the Query:**\n   - Write comments within the SQL code to explain the purpose of different parts of the query.\n   - Create external documentation that describes the query's purpose, the information it retrieves, and any assumptions or limitations.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically construct a PostgreSQL query that meets the user's requirements for retrieving classified sources from the ALeRCE database.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

The goal is to retrieve sources classified as AGN, QSO, or Blazar by the ALeRCE light curve classifier, while applying specific filters. Here are the detailed steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Required Information:**\n   - The user wants to retrieve sources classified as AGN, QSO, or Blazar.\n   - The sources must have a minimum number of detections of 30.\n   - The time span between the first and last detection must be at least 200 days.\n   - The predicted class probability must be higher than 0.5.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Tables:**\n   - The `object` table contains the main statistics of the sources, including the number of detections (`ndet`) and the time of first and last detection (`firstmjd` and `lastmjd`).\n   - The `probability` table contains the classification probabilities and class names, which will be used to filter the sources based on their classification.\n\n3. **Define the Selection Criteria:**\n   - From the `probability` table, we will filter for:\n     - `class_name` in ('AGN', 'QSO', 'Blazar')\n     - `ranking` = 1 (to get the most likely classification)\n     - `classifier_name` = 'lc_classifier' (to ensure we are using the light curve classifier)\n     - `probability` > 0.5 (to filter out sources with low confidence in their classification)\n   - From the `object` table, we will filter for:\n     - `ndet` >= 30 (minimum number of detections)\n     - The time span calculated as `lastmjd - firstmjd` >= 200 (minimum time span between detections)\n\n4. **Formulate the Query Structure:**\n   - Start with a `SELECT` statement to retrieve all columns from the relevant tables.\n   - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `object` and `probability` tables based on the `oid` column, which is the unique identifier for each object.\n   - Apply the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the defined selection criteria.\n\n5. **Document the Query Logic:**\n   - Clearly comment on the purpose of each part of the query, explaining the filters applied and the rationale behind the joins.\n   - Ensure that the query is structured in a way that is easy to understand and maintain.\n\n6. **Test the Query:**\n   - After constructing the query, it should be tested against the ALeRCE database to ensure it returns the expected results and performs efficiently.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically create a PostgreSQL query that meets the user's requirements for retrieving classified sources from the ALeRCE database.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Can you do a query to get sources classfied as AGN, QSO or Blazar by the ALeRCE light curve classifier, with a minimum number of detections of 30, and a minimum time span between the first and the last detection of 200 days, and also filtering out sources by a predicted class probability higher than 0.5?''"}], "max_tokens": 4000, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "n": 1}}

If you want to add comments, use the SQL comment format inside the query.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nTo generate a PostgreSQL query that retrieves objects from the ALeRCE database based on the user's request, follow these detailed steps:\n\n1. **Understand the User's Request:**\n   - The user wants to query objects that appeared between two specific dates (August 25, 2022, and September 10, 2022).\n   - The objects must be classified as 'supernova' by the stamp classifier.\n   - The objects must either have a probability greater than 0.5 or have more than one detection.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Tables:**\n   - The `object` table contains the main statistics of the objects, including detection times.\n   - The `probability` table contains classification probabilities and rankings for the objects, including the stamp classifier.\n   - The `detection` table contains information about the detections of the objects.\n\n3. **Define the Date Range:**\n   - Convert the specified dates into their corresponding MJD values:\n     - August 25, 2022 = 59816.0\n     - September 10, 2022 = 59832.0\n   - This will be used to filter the objects based on their detection times.\n\n4. **Set Default Conditions for the Probability Table:**\n   - Since the user is interested in classifications by the stamp classifier, set the condition:\n     - `probability.classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`\n   - Additionally, apply the condition for the probability:\n     - `probability.probability > 0.5`\n\n5. **Construct the Query Logic:**\n   - Start with the `object` table as the main table since it contains the detection times.\n   - Use a `LEFT JOIN` or `INNER JOIN` to connect the `object` table with the `probability` table to access classification information.\n   - Use another `LEFT JOIN` or `INNER JOIN` to connect the `object` table with the `detection` table to access detection counts.\n\n6. **Apply Filters:**\n   - Filter the results based on the detection times:\n     - `object.firstmjd >= 59816.0 AND object.lastmjd <= 59832.0`\n   - Filter for objects classified as 'supernova' by the stamp classifier:\n     - `probability.class_name = 'SN'` (assuming 'SN' is the correct class name for supernova in the stamp classifier).\n   - Include the condition for either having a probability greater than 0.5 or having more than one detection:\n     - Use a conditional statement to check if either:\n       - `probability.probability > 0.5`\n       - OR the count of detections (from the `detection` table) is greater than 1.\n\n7. **Group and Aggregate Data:**\n   - If using the detection count, you may need to group by the object identifier (`oid`) and count the number of detections for each object.\n   - Ensure to include the necessary columns in the `SELECT` statement to return relevant information about the objects.\n\n8. **Sort and Format the Results:**\n   - Decide if the results need to be sorted (e.g., by detection time or object identifier).\n   - Format the output to ensure clarity and usability for the user.\n\n9. **Document the Query:**\n   - Write comments within the SQL code to explain the purpose of different parts of the query.\n   - Create external documentation that describes the query's purpose, the information it retrieves, and any assumptions or limitations.\n\nBy following these steps, you will be able to construct a comprehensive and accurate SQL query that meets the user's request while adhering to the database schema and conditions specified.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: -- mjd date for August 25 2022 = 59816.0\n-- mjd date for September 10 2022 = 59832.0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Query objects which appeared between august 25 and september 10 of 2022, which are classified as supernova by the stamp classifier with a probability greater than 0.5 or which have more than one detection''"}], "max_tokens": 4000, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "n": 1}}

The goal is to retrieve specific information about ZTF objects that meet certain criteria related to their features and classifications.

The goal is to retrieve specific information about ZTF objects that meet certain criteria related to their features and classifications. Here are the detailed steps required to construct the query:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Tables:**\n   - The primary tables involved in this query are:\n     - `object`: Contains information about ZTF objects, including the ZTF identifier and the number of detections.\n     - `feature`: Contains features related to the objects, including the 'LinearTrend' feature and its associated filter identifier.\n     - `probability`: Contains classification probabilities and rankings for the objects.\n\n2. **Define the Selection Criteria:**\n   - The user requests to find cases where:\n     - The 'LinearTrend' feature value is greater than 5.\n     - The difference between the last and first detection date (`deltajd`) is greater than 1 day.\n   - Additionally, we need to ensure that we only retrieve the most likely classification (ranking = 1) from the `probability` table.\n\n3. **Determine Required Columns:**\n   - The user specifies the following columns to be returned:\n     - From the `object` table: ZTF identifier (`oid`) and number of detections (`ndet`).\n     - From the `probability` table: classifier version (`classifier_version`), class name (`class_name`), and probability (`probability`).\n     - From the `feature` table: value of 'LinearTrend' (`value`) and filter identifier (`fid`).\n\n4. **Construct the Query Logic:**\n   - Start by selecting from the `object` table and applying the condition on `deltajd` to filter objects with a difference greater than 1 day.\n   - Use an `INNER JOIN` to connect the `object` table with the `probability` table to get the classification data, ensuring to filter for `ranking = 1` and `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`.\n   - Use another `INNER JOIN` to connect the `object` table with the `feature` table to retrieve the 'LinearTrend' feature, applying the condition that its value is greater than 5.\n   - Limit the results to at most 10 cases.\n\n5. **Implement Sorting and Limiting:**\n   - Since the user requests a maximum of 10 cases, use the `LIMIT` clause to restrict the number of results returned.\n   - Optionally, consider sorting the results based on a relevant column (e.g., `ndet` or `value`) to ensure the most relevant cases are returned first.\n\n6. **Document the Query:**\n   - Prepare comments within the SQL code to clarify the purpose of each part of the query, explaining the joins and conditions applied.\n   - Create external documentation that outlines the query's purpose, the information it retrieves, and any assumptions or limitations.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically construct a PostgreSQL query that accurately retrieves the requested information from the ALeRCE database.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Find at most 10 cases where the feature called 'LinearTrend' is larger than 5 and their ZTF objects have a difference between last and first detection date larger than 1 day.

The goal is to retrieve all columns from the 'probability' and 'magstat' tables for ZTF objects that meet specific conditions. Here are the detailed steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Tables:**\n   - The user has requested data from two tables: `probability` and `magstat`.\n   - Ensure that both tables are included in the query.\n\n2. **Define the Selection Criteria:**\n   - The user specifies that the class 'asteroid' must be the first-ranked class in the `stamp_classifier`.\n   - Additionally, the objects must have a computed corrected light curve, which is indicated by the `corrected` column in the `magstat` table being `TRUE`.\n\n3. **Set Default Conditions for the Probability Table:**\n   - According to the general context, we need to apply the default conditions for the `probability` table:\n     - `probability.ranking = 1` (to get the most likely class).\n     - `probability.classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'` (to ensure we are looking at the correct classifier).\n\n4. **Join the Tables:**\n   - Since we need to retrieve data from both `probability` and `magstat`, we will perform an `INNER JOIN` between these two tables.\n   - The join should be based on the common column `oid`, which is the unique object identifier present in both tables.\n\n5. **Apply Filtering Conditions:**\n   - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the specified conditions:\n     - Ensure that `probability.class_name = 'asteroid'` to filter for the asteroid class.\n     - Ensure that `magstat.corrected = TRUE` to filter for objects with a computed corrected light curve.\n\n6. **Limit the Number of Rows:**\n   - Use the `LIMIT` clause to restrict the results to a maximum of 10 rows, as specified by the user.\n\n7. **Order the Results:**\n   - Use the `ORDER BY` clause to sort the results by the `oid` column from the `probability` table, ensuring that the output is organized as requested.\n\n8. **Construct the SELECT Statement:**\n   - Since the user requested all columns from both tables, the `SELECT` statement should include `SELECT *` to retrieve all columns from the joined tables.\n\n9. **Document the Query:**\n   - Although not part of the SQL code, it is important to document the purpose of the query, the conditions applied, and any assumptions made during the construction of the query.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically construct a PostgreSQL query that meets the user's requirements for retrieving data from the ALeRCE database.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Get all columns from the 'probability' and 'magstat' tables for ZTF objects that satisfy the following conditions: the 'asteroid' class is first ranked in the stamp classifier, and have a computed corrected light curve.

This will allow us to combine the matches with their corresponding features.\n\n5. **Select the Required Columns:**\n   - From the joined results, we will select the following columns:\n     - `oid` from the 'xmatch' table (ZTF identifier)\n     - `oid_catalog` from the 'xmatch' table (catalog identifier)\n     - `dist` from the 'xmatch' table (distance)\n     - `name` from the 'feature' table (feature name)\n     - `value` from the 'feature' table (feature value)\n\n6. **Sort the Results:**\n   - Finally, we will sort the results by `oid_catalog` (catalog object identifier) and `name` (feature name) to meet the user's request.\n\n7. **Document the Query:**\n   - Ensure that the query is well-documented with comments explaining each part, especially the purpose of the subqueries and the join conditions.\n\nBy following these steps, we will construct a comprehensive query that retrieves the desired information from the ALeRCE database while adhering to the specified conditions and requirements.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

The goal is to retrieve matches from the 'xmatch' table and specific features from the 'feature' table for the given ZTF identifiers. Here\u2019s how to break down the task into detailed steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Required Tables and Columns:**\n   - We need to work with the following tables:\n     - `xmatch`: to find matches for the specified ZTF identifiers.\n     - `feature`: to retrieve specific features ('W1-W2', 'g-W2', 'r-W2') for the matched objects.\n   - The relevant columns from these tables are:\n     - From `xmatch`: `oid` (ZTF identifier), `oid_catalog` (catalog identifier), `dist` (distance between counterparts).\n     - From `feature`: `oid` (ZTF identifier), `name` (feature name), `value` (feature value).\n\n2. **Define the ZTF Identifiers:**\n   - The ZTF identifiers specified in the request are 'ZTF19aazhdoy' and 'ZTF17aaaqqtd'. We will use these identifiers to filter our results.\n\n3. **Create a Subquery for the `xmatch` Table:**\n   - Construct a subquery to select all matches from the `xmatch` table where the `oid` is either 'ZTF19aazhdoy' or 'ZTF17aaaqqtd'.\n   - This subquery will return the columns: `oid`, `oid_catalog`, and `dist`.\n\n4. **Create a Subquery for the `feature` Table:**\n   - Construct another subquery to select features from the `feature` table.\n   - Filter this subquery to include only the features 'W1-W2', 'g-W2', and 'r-W2' and ensure that the version is 'lc_classifier_1.2.1-P'.\n   - This subquery will return the columns: `oid`, `name`, and `value`.\n\n5. **Join the Results:**\n   - Perform an `INNER JOIN` between the results of the `xmatch` subquery and the `feature` subquery on the `oid` column.\n   - This join will combine the matches with their corresponding features.\n\n6. **Select the Required Columns:**\n   - From the joined results, select the following columns:\n     - `oid` from the `xmatch` table (ZTF identifier).\n     - `oid_catalog` from the `xmatch` table (catalog identifier).\n     - `dist` from the `xmatch` table (distance).\n     - `name` from the `feature` table (feature name).\n     - `value` from the `feature` table (feature value).\n\n7. **Sort the Results:**\n   - Apply an `ORDER BY` clause to sort the results first by `oid_catalog` and then by `name`.\n\n8. **Document the Query:**\n   - Ensure that the query is well-documented with comments explaining each part, especially the purpose of the joins and the filters applied.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically construct a PostgreSQL query that meets the user's request for retrieving matches and features for the specified ZTF identifiers.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''For objects with ZTF identifiers 'ZTF19aazhdoy' and 'ZTF17aaaqqtd', find 1) all matches in the 'xmatch' table, and 2) features 'W1-W2', 'g-W2' and 'r-W2' in their 'lc_classifier_1.2.1-P' version.

The user wants to find all detections for a specific ZTF object and return specific columns sorted by detection date, along with all columns from the 'dataquality' table for the corresponding epochs. Here are the detailed steps to achieve this:\n\n1. **Identify the Main Table:**\n   - The main table for this query is the `detection` table, as it contains the detection information for the specified ZTF object.\n\n2. **Define the Selection Criteria:**\n   - The user specifies the ZTF object identifier as 'ZTF20actqnhg'. This will be used to filter the results in the `detection` table.\n   - The columns to be retrieved from the `detection` table are:\n     - `mjd` (detection date)\n     - `isdiffpos` (isdiffpos flag)\n     - `magpsf` (difference magnitude)\n     - `sigmapsf` (uncertainty of the difference magnitude)\n   - Additionally, all columns from the `dataquality` table corresponding to the detections for this object will be included.\n\n3. **Join the Dataquality Table:**\n   - Since the `dataquality` table contains quality metrics associated with each detection, we need to perform an `INNER JOIN` between the `detection` table and the `dataquality` table.\n   - The join condition will be based on the `candid` and `oid` columns, where `candid` from the `dataquality` table matches the `candid` from the `detection` table, and `oid` from both tables matches the specified object identifier.\n\n4. **Construct the Query:**\n   - Start with a `SELECT` statement to retrieve the specified columns from the `detection` table and all columns from the `dataquality` table.\n   - Use the `FROM` clause to specify the `detection` table and include the `INNER JOIN` with the `dataquality` table based on the join condition defined in the previous step.\n\n5. **Apply Filtering Conditions:**\n   - Add a `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include detections for the specified ZTF object 'ZTF20actqnhg'. This will involve checking the `oid` column in the `detection` table.\n\n6. **Sort the Results:**\n   - Use the `ORDER BY` clause to sort the results by the detection date, which corresponds to the `mjd` column in the `detection` table.\n\n7. **Document the Query:**\n   - Write comments within the SQL code to explain the purpose of different parts of the query, such as the filtering criteria and the join conditions.\n   - Create external documentation that describes the query's purpose, the information it retrieves, and any assumptions or limitations.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically construct a PostgreSQL query that meets the user's request for retrieving detection information for the specified ZTF object along with the associated data quality metrics.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

The goal is to find all detections for the ZTF object 'ZTF20actqnhg' and return specific columns sorted by detection date, along with all columns from the 'dataquality' table for the corresponding epochs. Here are the detailed steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Tables:**\n   - The primary table for detections is the `detection` table, which contains the detection date, isdiffpos flag, and difference magnitude with its uncertainty.\n   - The `dataquality` table contains additional quality metrics for each detection.\n\n2. **Define the Selection Criteria:**\n   - We need to filter the `detection` table for the specific object identified by the `oid` 'ZTF20actqnhg'.\n   - We will select the following columns from the `detection` table:\n     - `mjd` (detection date)\n     - `isdiffpos` (isdiffpos flag)\n     - `magpsf` (difference magnitude)\n     - `sigmapsf` (uncertainty of the difference magnitude)\n   - We will also retrieve all columns from the `dataquality` table that correspond to the detections of this object.\n\n3. **Join the Tables:**\n   - To retrieve data from both the `detection` and `dataquality` tables, we will perform an `INNER JOIN` between these two tables.\n   - The join condition will be based on the `candid` and `oid` columns, ensuring that we only get data from the `dataquality` table that corresponds to the detections of the specified object.\n\n4. **Construct the Query:**\n   - Start with a `SELECT` statement to specify the columns to retrieve:\n     - From the `detection` table: `mjd`, `isdiffpos`, `magpsf`, `sigmapsf`.\n     - From the `dataquality` table: use `dataquality.*` to select all columns.\n   - Use the `FROM` clause to specify the `detection` table and include the `INNER JOIN` with the `dataquality` table based on the appropriate keys.\n\n5. **Apply Filtering Conditions:**\n   - Add a `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include detections for the object with `oid = 'ZTF20actqnhg'`.\n\n6. **Sort the Results:**\n   - Use the `ORDER BY` clause to sort the results by the detection date (`mjd`) in ascending order.\n\n7. **Document the Query:**\n   - Ensure that comments are included in the SQL code to explain the purpose of each part of the query, such as the selection of columns, join conditions, and sorting criteria.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically construct a PostgreSQL query that meets the user's request for retrieving all detections for the specified ZTF object along with the relevant data quality metrics.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Find all detections for the ZTF object 'ZTF20actqnhg'.

This subquery will return the identifiers of the ZTF objects that meet the classification criteria.\n\n5. **Join with the Object Table:**\n   - Use an INNER JOIN to connect the results of the subquery from step 4 with the 'object' table to ensure we are working with valid ZTF objects.\n\n6. **Join with the Xmatch Table:**\n   - Perform another INNER JOIN between the results from step 5 and the 'xmatch' table using the `oid` to retrieve additional information about the matched objects.\n\n7. **Join with the Allwise Table:**\n   - Perform another INNER JOIN between the results from step 6 and the 'allwise' table using the `oid_catalog` from the 'xmatch' table to retrieve information from the ALLWISE catalog.\n\n8. **Select Distinct Objects:**\n   - Use the DISTINCT keyword to ensure that the results contain unique ZTF objects.\n\n9. **Limit the Results:**\n   - Apply a LIMIT clause to restrict the results to at most 200 distinct objects.\n\n10. **Select All Columns:**\n    - Specify that all columns from the 'xmatch' and 'allwise' tables should be included in the final output.\n\n11. **Document the Query:**\n    - Write comments within the SQL code to explain the purpose of different parts of the query, ensuring clarity for future reference.\n\nBy following these steps, you will be able to construct a comprehensive and efficient SQL query that meets the user's request while adhering to the database schema and conditions provided.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

Create a sub-query using the 'probability' TABLE filtering the desired objects.\nII. For each feature, you have to make a sub-query retrieving the specific feature adding the condition of its value, taking only the oids in the 'probability' sub-query with an INNER JOIN inside each 'feature' sub-query to retrieve only the features associated with the desired spatial objects.\nIII.

Add the remaining conditions to the final result of step V, using the 'probability' sub-query from step I.\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nTo generate a PostgreSQL query that retrieves ZTF objects based on the specified conditions, we will follow a systematic decomposition plan. Here are the detailed steps required to construct the query:\n\n1. **Understand the Requirements:**\n   - We need to find ZTF objects that have a probability greater than 0.7 of being classified as either 'LPV' (Long Period Variable) or 'E' (Eclipsing Binary) in the light curve classifier version 'hierarchical_rf_1.1.0'.\n   - Additionally, we need to ensure that the closest Gaia objects have not changed compared to their first alerts.\n   - The result should include all columns from both the 'probability' and 'gaia_ztf' tables, and limit the output to a maximum of 50 rows.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**\n   - The main tables involved are:\n     - `probability`: This table contains classification probabilities and rankings.\n     - `gaia_ztf`: This table contains information about the closest Gaia objects.\n   - Relevant columns from the `probability` table include:\n     - `oid` (object identifier)\n     - `probability` (probability value)\n     - `classifier_name` (to filter by the specific classifier version)\n   - Relevant columns from the `gaia_ztf` table include:\n     - `oid` (object identifier)\n     - `unique1` (to check if the closest object has changed)\n\n3. **Formulate the Query Requirements:**\n   - We will filter the `probability` table for entries where:\n     - `probability > 0.7`\n     - `class_name` is either 'LPV' or 'E'\n     - `classifier_name` is 'hierarchical_rf_1.1.0'\n   - We will also filter the `gaia_ztf` table to include only those entries where `unique1` is `FALSE`, indicating that the closest Gaia object has not changed.\n\n4. **Design the Query:**\n   - Start by creating a subquery to filter the `probability` table based on the specified conditions. This subquery will select the `oid` of objects that meet the probability and classification criteria.\n   - Next, perform an `INNER JOIN` between the filtered `probability` subquery and the `gaia_ztf` table on the `oid` column to ensure we only get objects that have corresponding Gaia data.\n   - Apply a `WHERE` clause to the joined result to filter for `gaia_ztf.unique1 = FALSE`.\n   - Finally, select all columns from both the `probability` and `gaia_ztf` tables and limit the results to 50 rows using the `LIMIT` clause.\n\n5. **Document the Query:**\n   - Ensure that comments are included in the SQL code to explain the purpose of each part of the query.\n   - Create external documentation that describes the overall purpose of the query, the specific conditions being applied, and any assumptions made during the construction of the query.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically construct a PostgreSQL query that meets the user's request for retrieving ZTF objects based on the specified conditions.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Find ZTF objects that satisfy the following conditions: have a probability larger than 0.7 of being either long period variable or eclipsing binary in the light curve classifier version 'hierarchical_rf_1.1.0', and their closest Gaia objects have not changed compared to their first alerts.

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier'\n### IF THE 'feature' TABLE is used with 2 or more features, you need to take the following steps, because it is a transposed table (each feature is in a different row).\nI. Create a sub-query using the 'probability' TABLE filtering the desired objects.\nII. For each feature, you have to make a sub-query retrieving the specific feature adding the condition of its value, taking only the oids in the 'probability' sub-query with an INNER JOIN inside each 'feature' sub-query to retrieve only the features associated with the desired spatial objects.\nIII. Make an UNION between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nIV. Make an INTERSECT between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nV. Filter the 'UNION' query from step III selecting only the 'oids' that are in the 'INTERSECT' query from step IV\nVI. Add the remaining conditions to the final result of step V, using the 'probability' sub-query from step I.\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nTo generate a PostgreSQL query that retrieves ZTF objects with a probability larger than 0.5 of being a long period variable (LPV) in the light curve classifier, along with a WISE W1 magnitude between 7 and 8, and to return all columns from the 'probability', 'xmatch', and 'allwise' tables, follow these detailed steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Requirements:**\n   - We need to find objects classified as 'LPV' with a probability greater than 0.5.\n   - We also need to filter these objects based on their WISE W1 magnitude, specifically between 7 and 8.\n   - The final output should include all columns from the 'probability', 'xmatch', and 'allwise' tables, limited to 100 rows.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**\n   - The 'probability' table will be used to filter objects based on their classification and probability.\n   - The 'xmatch' table will be used to link ZTF objects to their corresponding catalog entries.\n   - The 'allwise' table will provide the WISE W1 magnitude information.\n\n3. **Set Default Conditions for the Probability Table:**\n   - According to the default conditions, we will filter the 'probability' table to only include rows where:\n     - `ranking = 1` (to get the most likely class)\n     - `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'` (to ensure we are using the correct classifier)\n     - `class_name = 'LPV'` (to filter for long period variables)\n     - `probability > 0.5` (to ensure the probability is greater than 0.5)\n\n4. **Create a Subquery for the Probability Table:**\n   - Construct a subquery that selects the `oid` from the 'probability' table based on the conditions defined in step 3. This subquery will be used to filter the objects in the subsequent steps.\n\n5. **Join with the Xmatch Table:**\n   - Use an INNER JOIN to connect the results of the probability subquery with the 'xmatch' table on the `oid` column. This will allow us to retrieve the matched catalog information for the selected ZTF objects.\n\n6. **Join with the Allwise Table:**\n   - Perform another INNER JOIN between the results of the previous join (probability and xmatch) and the 'allwise' table on the `oid_catalog` column from the 'xmatch' table and the `oid_catalog` column from the 'allwise' table. This will provide access to the WISE W1 magnitude data.\n\n7. **Filter by WISE W1 Magnitude:**\n   - Add a WHERE clause to filter the results based on the WISE W1 magnitude, specifically ensuring that `w1mpro` (the WISE W1 magnitude) is between 7 and 8.\n\n8. **Select Required Columns:**\n   - Specify that all columns from the 'probability', 'xmatch', and 'allwise' tables should be selected. This can be done using the `SELECT *` statement for each of the joined tables.\n\n9. **Limit the Results:**\n   - Use the `LIMIT` clause to restrict the output to a maximum of 100 rows.\n\n10. **Document the Query:**\n    - Ensure that comments are included in the SQL code to explain the purpose of each part of the query, including the filtering criteria and the joins.\n\nBy following these steps, you will be able to construct a comprehensive and efficient SQL query that meets the user's request for retrieving ZTF objects with the specified characteristics from the ALeRCE database.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Find ZTF objects that have a probability larger than 0.5 of being a long period variable in the light curve classifier, as well as a WISE W1 magnitude between 7 and 8.

The plan will break down the problem into manageable steps, ensuring that all necessary details are included for an accurate and optimal query.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Requirements\n- The user wants to find up to 50 ZTF objects that meet specific conditions:\n  1. Probability of being an AGN greater than 0.7 in the light curve classifier version 'hierarchical_rf_1.1.0'.\n  2. Distance to the nearest PS1 source less than 2 arcseconds.\n  3. Difference between the PS1 star/galaxy score and the SExtractor star/galaxy score less than 0.5.\n- The user requests specific columns to be returned:\n  - From the ZTF object: ZTF identifier and probability.\n  - For each epoch: candidate and filter identifier, reduced chi-square, star/galaxy score from SExtractor.\n  - From the PS1 source: identifier, PS1 star/galaxy score, and distance to the nearest PS1 source.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Relevant Tables and Columns\n- **Tables to be used:**\n  - `probability`: for classification probabilities and rankings.\n  - `object`: for ZTF object details.\n  - `ps1_ztf`: for information about the nearest PS1 sources.\n- **Columns to be selected:**\n  - From `object`: `oid` (ZTF identifier), `probability`.\n  - From `ps1_ztf`: `candid` (candidate identifier), `objectidps1` (PS1 identifier), `sgscore1` (PS1 star/galaxy score), `distpsnr1` (distance to the nearest PS1 source).\n  - From `SExtractor`: `sgscore` (star/galaxy score from SExtractor), `red_chi2` (reduced chi-square).\n\n### Step 3: Formulate the Query Requirements\n- **Selection Criteria:**\n  - Filter `probability` for AGN with a probability greater than 0.7 and classifier version 'hierarchical_rf_1.1.0'.\n  - Join with `object` to get ZTF identifiers and probabilities.\n  - Join with `ps1_ztf` to get the nearest PS1 source information.\n  - Ensure the distance to the nearest PS1 source is less than 2 arcseconds.\n  - Calculate the difference between the PS1 star/galaxy score and the SExtractor score, ensuring it is less than 0.5.\n\n### Step 4: Design the Query\n1. **Sub-query for Probability:**\n   - Create a sub-query to filter the `probability` table for entries where:\n     - `probability.class_name = 'AGN'`\n     - `probability.probability > 0.7`\n     - `probability.classifier_version = 'hierarchical_rf_1.1.0'`\n   - Select the `oid` from this sub-query.\n\n2. **Join with Object Table:**\n   - Use an INNER JOIN between the `object` table and the sub-query from step 1 to retrieve ZTF identifiers and probabilities.\n\n3. **Join with PS1 Table:**\n   - Use another INNER JOIN with the `ps1_ztf` table to get the nearest PS1 source information.\n   - Filter for `distpsnr1 < 2` to ensure the distance condition is met.\n\n4. **Join with SExtractor Data:**\n   - Assuming SExtractor data is available in a separate table (not specified in the request), perform an INNER JOIN with this table to retrieve the `sgscore` and `red_chi2`.\n   - Ensure the condition `ABS(ps1.sgscore1 - sextractor.sgscore) < 0.5` is applied to filter the results based on the star/galaxy score difference.\n\n5. **Limit the Results:**\n   - Use the `LIMIT` clause to restrict the results to at most 50 entries.\n\n6. **Select the Required Columns:**\n   - Specify the columns to be returned in the final result set, including:\n     - From `object`: `oid`, `probability`.\n     - From `ps1_ztf`: `candid`, `objectidps1`, `sgscore1`, `distpsnr1`.\n     - From SExtractor: `sgscore`, `red_chi2`.\n\n### Step 5: Document the Query\n- Write comments within the SQL code to explain the purpose of different parts of the query.\n- Create external documentation that describes the query's purpose, the information it retrieves, and any assumptions or limitations.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically construct a PostgreSQL query that meets the user's requirements while ensuring optimal performance and accuracy.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nTo generate a PostgreSQL query that retrieves the specified information from the ALeRCE database based on the user's request, we will follow a systematic decomposition plan. The plan will break down the problem into manageable steps, ensuring that all necessary details are included for an accurate and optimal query.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Requirements\n- The user wants to find up to 50 ZTF objects that meet specific conditions:\n  1. Probability of being an AGN greater than 0.7 in the light curve classifier version 'hierarchical_rf_1.1.0'.\n  2. Distance to the nearest PS1 source less than 2 arcseconds.\n  3. Difference between the PS1 star/galaxy score and the SExtractor star/galaxy score less than 0.5.\n- The user requests specific columns to be returned:\n  - From the ZTF object: ZTF identifier and probability.\n  - For each epoch: candidate and filter identifier, reduced chi-square, star/galaxy score from SExtractor.\n  - From the PS1 source: identifier, PS1 star/galaxy score, and distance to the nearest PS1 source.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Relevant Tables and Columns\n- **Tables to be used:**\n  - `probability`: for classification probabilities and rankings.\n  - `object`: for ZTF object details.\n  - `ps1_ztf`: for information about the nearest PS1 sources.\n- **Columns to be selected:**\n  - From `object`: `oid` (ZTF identifier), `probability`.\n  - From `ps1_ztf`: `candid` (candidate identifier), `objectidps1` (PS1 identifier), `sgscore1` (PS1 star/galaxy score), `distpsnr1` (distance to the nearest PS1 source).\n  - From `object` or a related table (not specified in the request but assumed to be available): `reduced_chi_square`, `sgscore` (SExtractor star/galaxy score).\n\n### Step 3: Formulate the Query Requirements\n- **Selection Criteria:**\n  - Filter `probability` for `class_name = 'AGN'`, `probability > 0.7`, and `classifier_version = 'hierarchical_rf_1.1.0'`.\n  - Join with `object` to get ZTF identifiers and probabilities.\n  - Join with `ps1_ztf` to get PS1 source information.\n  - Apply additional filters for distance and score differences.\n\n### Step 4: Design the Query\n1. **Sub-query for Probability:**\n   - Create a sub-query to filter the `probability` table for AGN with the specified conditions (probability > 0.7 and classifier version).\n   - This sub-query will return the `oid` of the objects that meet these criteria.\n\n2. **Join with Object Table:**\n   - Use an INNER JOIN between the `probability` sub-query and the `object` table to retrieve the ZTF identifiers and their probabilities.\n\n3. **Join with PS1 Table:**\n   - Use another INNER JOIN between the result of the previous step and the `ps1_ztf` table to get the nearest PS1 source information.\n   - Filter for `distpsnr1 < 2` to ensure the distance condition is met.\n\n4. **Calculate Score Difference:**\n   - Include a condition to filter the results based on the difference between the PS1 star/galaxy score and the SExtractor star/galaxy score (assumed to be available in the relevant table).\n\n5. **Select Required Columns:**\n   - Specify the columns to be returned in the final result set, including the ZTF identifier, probability, candidate identifier, reduced chi-square, SExtractor star/galaxy score, PS1 identifier, PS1 star/galaxy score, and distance.\n\n6. **Limit the Results:**\n   - Use the `LIMIT` clause to restrict the output to at most 50 records.\n\n### Step 5: Document the Query\n- Write comments within the SQL code to explain the purpose of each part of the query.\n- Create external documentation that describes the query's purpose, the information it retrieves, and any assumptions or limitations.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically construct a PostgreSQL query that meets the user's requirements while ensuring optimal performance and accuracy.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Find at most 50 ZTF objects that satisfy the following conditions: have a probability larger than 0.7 of being an AGN in the light curve classifier version 'hierarchical_rf_1.1.0', a distance to the nearest PS1 source lower than 2 arcsec, and a difference between the star/galaxy score from PS1 and the star/galaxy score from SExtractor lower than 0.5.

Here are the detailed steps required to construct the query:\n\n1. **Understand the Requirements:**\n   - We need to find ZTF objects that have a probability greater than 0.6 of being classified as either 'CEP' (Cepheid), 'DSCT' (Delta Scuti), or 'RRL' (RR Lyrae) in the light curve classifier version 'hierarchical_rf_1.1.0'.\n   - Additionally, the closest PS1 objects associated with these ZTF objects must have a star/galaxy score greater than 0.8.\n   - The final output should include all columns from the 'probability' and 'ps1_ztf' tables, limited to a maximum of 100 rows.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**\n   - The relevant tables are:\n     - `probability`: This table contains classification probabilities and rankings.\n     - `ps1_ztf`: This table contains information about the closest sources in the Pan-STARRS catalog.\n   - Key columns to consider:\n     - From `probability`: `oid`, `class_name`, `probability`, `classifier_name`, `classifier_version`.\n     - From `ps1_ztf`: `oid`, `sgscore1`, `sgscore2`, `sgscore3`.\n\n3. **Formulate the Query Requirements:**\n   - We will filter the `probability` table for entries where:\n     - `probability.class_name` is either 'CEP', 'DSCT', or 'RRL'.\n     - `probability.probability` is greater than 0.6.\n     - `probability.classifier_name` is 'lc_classifier'.\n     - `probability.classifier_version` is 'hierarchical_rf_1.1.0'.\n   - We will also filter the `ps1_ztf` table for entries where:\n     - The star/galaxy score (`sgscore1`, `sgscore2`, or `sgscore3`) is greater than 0.8.\n\n4. **Design the Query:**\n   - Start by creating a subquery to filter the `probability` table based on the specified conditions. This subquery will return the `oid` of the objects that meet the probability criteria.\n   - Next, create a main query that joins the `ps1_ztf` table with the results of the subquery from the `probability` table using an INNER JOIN on the `oid` column.\n   - In the main query, apply the condition to filter the PS1 objects based on the star/galaxy score. This can be done using a WHERE clause that checks if any of the `sgscore` columns are greater than 0.8.\n   - Finally, select all columns from both the `probability` and `ps1_ztf` tables and limit the results to 100 rows.\n\n5. **Document the Query:**\n   - Ensure that the query is well-commented to explain the purpose of each part, especially the filtering conditions and the joins.\n   - Create external documentation that outlines the query's purpose, the information it retrieves, and any assumptions or limitations.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically construct a PostgreSQL query that meets the user's request for retrieving ZTF objects based on the specified conditions.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nTo generate a PostgreSQL query that retrieves ZTF objects based on the specified conditions, we will follow a systematic decomposition plan. Here are the detailed steps required to construct the query:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**\n   - The main tables involved are `probability` and `ps1_ztf`.\n   - From the `probability` table, we need the columns: `oid`, `probability`, `class_name`, and `classifier_version`.\n   - From the `ps1_ztf` table, we need the columns: `oid`, `sgscore1`, `sgscore2`, `sgscore3`, and any other relevant columns as specified by the user.\n\n2. **Define the Selection Criteria:**\n   - We need to filter the `probability` table for objects with:\n     - A `probability` greater than 0.6.\n     - A `class_name` that is either 'CEP' (Cepheid), 'DSCT' (Delta Scuti), or 'RRL' (RR Lyrae).\n     - A `classifier_version` of 'hierarchical_rf_1.1.0'.\n   - For the `ps1_ztf` table, we need to filter for objects where the `sgscore1`, `sgscore2`, or `sgscore3` is greater than 0.8.\n\n3. **Create a Subquery for the Probability Table:**\n   - Construct a subquery that selects `oid` from the `probability` table based on the defined criteria (probability > 0.6, class_name in the specified classes, and classifier_version = 'hierarchical_rf_1.1.0').\n   - This subquery will return a list of `oid`s that meet the probability conditions.\n\n4. **Create a Subquery for the PS1 Table:**\n   - Construct a subquery that selects `oid` from the `ps1_ztf` table where at least one of the `sgscore1`, `sgscore2`, or `sgscore3` is greater than 0.8.\n   - This subquery will return a list of `oid`s that meet the PS1 score conditions.\n\n5. **Join the Two Subqueries:**\n   - Use an `INNER JOIN` between the results of the two subqueries on the `oid` column. This will ensure that we only get `oid`s that are present in both the `probability` and `ps1_ztf` tables.\n\n6. **Select Required Columns:**\n   - From the joined results, select all columns from both the `probability` and `ps1_ztf` tables. This can be done using `SELECT probability.*, ps1_ztf.*`.\n\n7. **Limit the Results:**\n   - Apply a `LIMIT` clause to restrict the output to a maximum of 100 rows, as specified in the user request.\n\n8. **Document the Query:**\n   - Write comments within the SQL code to explain the purpose of different parts of the query, ensuring clarity and maintainability.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically construct a PostgreSQL query that meets the user's requirements for retrieving ZTF objects based on the specified conditions.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Find ZTF objects that satisfy the following conditions: have a probability larger than 0.6 of being either Cepheid or delta Scuti or RR Lyra in the light curve classifier version 'hierarchical_rf_1.1.0', and their closest PS1 objects have a star/galaxy score larger than 0.8.

This will facilitate easier referencing in the main query.\n\n4. **Query the ALLWISE Table:**\n   - Use the `q3c_radial_query` function to find ALLWISE objects that lie within the specified search radii of the input objects. \n   - Perform two separate queries for each input object:\n     - For id_1, check if ALLWISE objects are within the radius of 5/3600 degrees.\n     - For id_2, check if ALLWISE objects are within the radius of 10/3600 degrees.\n\n5. **Combine Results Using UNION:**\n   - Combine the results from the two queries using a `UNION` statement to ensure that all matching ALLWISE objects from both searches are included in the final result set.\n\n6. **Select Required Columns:**\n   - For the output, select the following columns:\n     - From the temporary table: identifier as 'id', coordinates as 'obj_ra' and 'obj_dec', and the search radius used as 'r_deg'.\n     - From the ALLWISE table: identifier in the ALLWISE catalog, RA, Dec coordinates, and magnitude (W1) along with its uncertainty.\n\n7. **Format the Output:**\n   - Ensure that the output is formatted correctly, with appropriate aliases for each column as specified in the user request.\n\n8. **Final Query Structure:**\n   - Structure the final query to include the CTE for input objects, the radial queries for ALLWISE objects, and the UNION of results, ensuring that all selected columns are included in the final output.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically construct a PostgreSQL query that meets the user's request for retrieving ALLWISE objects based on proximity to specified input objects.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

Create a sub-query using the 'probability' TABLE filtering the desired objects.\nII. For each feature, you have to make a sub-query retrieving the specific feature adding the condition of its value, taking only the oids in the 'probability' sub-query with an INNER JOIN inside each 'feature' sub-query to retrieve only the features associated with the desired spatial objects.\nIII. Make an UNION between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nIV. Make an INTERSECT between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nV. Filter the 'UNION' query from step III selecting only the 'oids' that are in the 'INTERSECT' query from step IV\nVI. Add the remaining conditions to the final result of step V, using the 'probability' sub-query from step I.\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nTo generate a PostgreSQL query that retrieves ALLWISE objects based on the specified conditions, we can break down the task into a series of systematic steps:\n\n1. **Identify Input Parameters:**\n   - Define the input objects with their identifiers and coordinates:\n     - Object 1: id_1 with coordinates (RA, Dec) = (132.961, 41.397)\n     - Object 2: id_2 with coordinates (RA, Dec) = (139.01, 41.5653)\n   - Define the search radii for each object:\n     - For id_1, the radius is 5 arcseconds (which needs to be converted to degrees).\n     - For id_2, the radius is 10 arcseconds (also converted to degrees).\n\n2. **Convert Arcseconds to Degrees:**\n   - Calculate the equivalent degrees for the search radii:\n     - 5 arcseconds = 5 / 3600 degrees\n     - 10 arcseconds = 10 / 3600 degrees\n\n3. **Create a Temporary Table for Input Objects:**\n   - Use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to define a temporary table that includes the input objects and their respective search radii. This table will have the following columns:\n     - `id` (identifier)\n     - `obj_ra` (right ascension)\n     - `obj_dec` (declination)\n     - `r_deg` (search radius in degrees)\n\n4. **Query the ALLWISE Table:**\n   - Use the `allwise` table to retrieve the objects that match the criteria. The relevant columns to select from this table include:\n     - `oid_catalog` (identifier in the ALLWISE catalog)\n     - `ra` (right ascension)\n     - `dec` (declination)\n     - `w1mpro` (magnitude in the WISE W1 filter)\n     - `w1sigmpro` (uncertainty in the WISE W1 filter)\n\n5. **Perform Spatial Queries Using Q3C Functions:**\n   - For each input object, use the Q3C functions to find ALLWISE objects within the specified search radius:\n     - For id_1, use `q3c_radial_query` to check if the ALLWISE objects are within the 5 arcsecond radius.\n     - For id_2, use `q3c_radial_query` to check if the ALLWISE objects are within the 10 arcsecond radius.\n\n6. **Combine Results:**\n   - Use a `UNION` to combine the results from both spatial queries. This will ensure that you get ALLWISE objects that are within the specified radii for both input objects.\n\n7. **Select Final Output Columns:**\n   - From the combined results, select the necessary columns to return:\n     - From the temporary table: `id`, `obj_ra`, `obj_dec`, `r_deg`\n     - From the ALLWISE table: `oid_catalog`, `ra`, `dec`, `w1mpro`, `w1sigmpro`\n\n8. **Format the Output:**\n   - Ensure that the output is formatted correctly, with appropriate aliases for the columns as specified in the user request.\n\n9. **Test the Query:**\n   - After constructing the query, it is essential to test it against the ALeRCE database to ensure it returns the expected results and performs efficiently.\n\nBy following these steps, you will be able to construct a comprehensive PostgreSQL query that meets the user's request for retrieving ALLWISE objects based on the specified criteria.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Find all ALLWISE objects that lie within 5 arcsec of an object called id_1, that has coordinates (RA, Dec) = (132.961, 41.397) deg, or within 10 arcsec of  an object called id_2, having coordinates (RA, Dec) = (139.01, 41.5653).

In terms of magnitudes, this means that the `ssmagnr` value must be less than 19.2 (since fainter means larger).\n   - The ZTF objects of interest are specified, so we will filter the results based on these identifiers.\n\n4. **Formulate the Query Requirements:**\n   - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter the `ss_ztf` table for the specified ZTF object identifiers.\n   - Additionally, apply a condition to filter for MPC magnitudes that are less than 19.2.\n   - Since the user wants to retrieve identifiers from both ZTF and MPC, ensure that the query selects the appropriate columns.\n\n5. **Design the Query:**\n   - Start with a `SELECT` statement to retrieve the required columns: `oid` (ZTF identifier), `ssnamenr` (MPC identifier), and `ssmagnr` (MPC magnitude).\n   - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter for the specified ZTF object identifiers and the condition for MPC magnitude.\n   - Include an `ORDER BY` clause to sort the results by `ssmagnr` in descending order.\n\n6. **Document the Query:**\n   - Prepare comments within the SQL code to clarify the purpose of each part of the query, such as the filtering criteria and sorting order.\n   - Create external documentation that outlines the query's purpose, the information it retrieves, and any assumptions made (e.g., the interpretation of brightness in terms of magnitude).\n\nBy following these steps, you will be able to construct an accurate and efficient SQL query to retrieve the requested information from the ALeRCE database.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: Note that 'fainter' means 'larger' for magnitudes\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''For ZTF objects 'ZTF20abmaqeh', 'ZTF18abwxduj' and 'ZTF19aactlln', find all MPC objects brighter than 19.2 mag in the MPC archive.

Create a sub-query using the 'probability' TABLE filtering the desired objects.\nII. For each feature, you have to make a sub-query retrieving the specific feature adding the condition of its value, taking only the oids in the 'probability' sub-query with an INNER JOIN inside each 'feature' sub-query to retrieve only the features associated with the desired spatial objects.\nIII. Make an UNION between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nIV. Make an INTERSECT between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nV. Filter the 'UNION' query from step III selecting only the 'oids' that are in the 'INTERSECT' query from step IV\nVI. Add the remaining conditions to the final result of step V, using the 'probability' sub-query from step I.\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text.

The goal is to retrieve specific information about ZTF objects from the ALeRCE database, focusing on certain conditions and columns. Here are the detailed steps required to construct the query:\n\n1. **Understand the Required Information:**\n   - The user wants to find ZTF objects with a specific condition on the 'W1-W2' color feature.\n   - The required columns to return are:\n     - ZTF identifier (from the `object` table, specifically the `oid` column).\n     - Number of detections (from the `object` table, specifically the `ndet` column).\n     - Difference between minimum g- and r-band difference magnitudes (this will require calculations based on the `feature` table).\n     - 'W1-W2' feature value (from the `feature` table, which needs to be renamed to `w1_w2`).\n     - Feature version (from the `feature` table).\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Tables:**\n   - The main tables involved are:\n     - `object`: Contains the ZTF identifier and number of detections.\n     - `feature`: Contains the feature values, including 'W1-W2' and the difference magnitudes.\n\n3. **Define the Conditions:**\n   - The user specifies that the 'W1-W2' color must be lower than 1. This will be a filtering condition in the `WHERE` clause.\n   - We need to ensure that we are only selecting the most relevant features from the `feature` table, specifically the 'W1-W2' feature.\n\n4. **Formulate the Query Requirements:**\n   - We will need to join the `object` and `feature` tables based on the `oid` column in the `object` table and the `oid` column in the `feature` table.\n   - We will apply a `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the 'W1-W2' color condition.\n   - We will also need to calculate the difference between the minimum g- and r-band difference magnitudes. This will involve selecting the relevant features for g and r bands and performing the calculation.\n\n5. **Design the Query:**\n   - Start with a `SELECT` statement to retrieve the required columns.\n   - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `object` and `feature` tables on the `oid` column.\n   - Include a `WHERE` clause to filter for 'W1-W2' values less than 1.\n   - Use a `GROUP BY` clause if necessary to ensure that we can calculate the difference between the g- and r-band magnitudes correctly.\n   - Limit the results to a maximum of 100 rows using the `LIMIT` clause.\n\n6. **Document the Query:**\n   - Write comments within the SQL code to explain the purpose of different parts of the query.\n   - Create external documentation that describes the query's purpose, the information it retrieves, and any assumptions or limitations.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically construct a PostgreSQL query that meets the user's request for retrieving ZTF objects with specific characteristics from the ALeRCE database.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

This will be used as a condition in the `WHERE` clause.\n   - The difference between minimum g- and r-band difference magnitudes needs to be calculated. This will involve selecting the `value` from the `feature` table where `name` corresponds to 'delta_mag_fid' for both g and r bands.\n\n4. **Formulate the Query Requirements:**\n   - Use an `INNER JOIN` between the `object` and `feature` tables to combine the necessary information.\n   - The join condition will be based on the `oid` column in the `object` table and the `oid` column in the `feature` table.\n   - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the 'W1-W2' color condition.\n\n5. **Calculate the Difference Between g- and r-band Magnitudes:**\n   - Use a subquery or a `CASE` statement to calculate the difference between the minimum g-band and r-band difference magnitudes. This will involve selecting the `value` from the `feature` table for both bands and performing the subtraction.\n\n6. **Select and Rename Columns:**\n   - In the `SELECT` statement, include the required columns:\n     - `oid` from the `object` table.\n     - `ndet` from the `object` table.\n     - The calculated difference between g- and r-band difference magnitudes.\n     - The 'W1-W2' feature value from the `feature` table, renaming it to `w1_w2`.\n     - The `version` from the `feature` table.\n\n7. **Limit the Number of Rows Returned:**\n   - Use the `LIMIT` clause to restrict the results to a maximum of 100 rows.\n\n8. **Document the Query:**\n   - Write comments within the SQL code to explain the purpose of different parts of the query, ensuring clarity for future reference.\n\nBy following these steps, you will be able to construct a PostgreSQL query that accurately retrieves the requested information from the ALeRCE database while adhering to the specified conditions and requirements.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Find ZTF objects that have 'W1-W2' color lower than 1.

This table will be the primary focus of the query.\n\n2. **Define the Required Columns:**\n   - The user has specified the following columns to be returned:\n     - ZTF identifier (which corresponds to the `oid` column in the `magstat` table)\n     - Number of detections (which corresponds to the `ndet` column in the `magstat` table)\n     - Initial rise estimate (which corresponds to the `dmdt_first` column in the `magstat` table)\n     - First difference magnitude (which corresponds to the `dm_first` column in the `magstat` table)\n\n3. **Specify the Conditions:**\n   - The user wants to filter the results based on specific ZTF identifiers: 'ZTF20adadshh', 'ZTF21aaabvit', and 'ZTF21aaabvjk'.\n   - Additionally, the user wants to find rows where the number of dubious corrections (`ndubious` column) is zero.\n   - The user is specifically interested in the g band, which corresponds to the `fid` value of 1 in the `magstat` table.\n\n4. **Construct the WHERE Clause:**\n   - Create a `WHERE` clause that includes:\n     - A condition to filter for the specified ZTF identifiers using the `oid` column.\n     - A condition to ensure that `ndubious` is equal to zero.\n     - A condition to filter for the g band by checking if `fid` is equal to 1.\n\n5. **Select the Required Columns:**\n   - In the `SELECT` statement, specify the columns to be returned as identified in step 2:\n     - `oid` (for the ZTF identifier)\n     - `ndet` (for the number of detections)\n     - `dmdt_first` (for the initial rise estimate)\n     - `dm_first` (for the first difference magnitude)\n\n6. **Formulate the Final Query Structure:**\n   - The query will be structured as follows:\n     - Start with the `SELECT` statement to specify the columns.\n     - Use the `FROM` clause to indicate the `magstat` table.\n     - Include the `WHERE` clause constructed in step 4 to filter the results based on the specified conditions.\n\n7. **Review and Optimize:**\n   - Ensure that the query adheres to the database schema and naming conventions.\n   - Check that the conditions are correctly applied to retrieve the desired results efficiently.\n\nBy following these steps, you will be able to construct a PostgreSQL query that accurately retrieves the requested information from the ALeRCE database.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier' ; this will return the classifications by the light curve classifier\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n# If you need to use 2 tables, try using a INNER JOIN statement, or a sub-query over 'probability' or 'object', if the query requires it. It is important to be really careful with the use of sub-queries or JOINs, as they can slow down the query.\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Answer ONLY with the final SQL query, with the following format: \n  ```sql SQL_QUERY_HERE ```\nDON'T include anything else in your answer. If you want to add comments, use the SQL comment format inside the query.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nTo generate a PostgreSQL query that retrieves the requested information from the ALeRCE database based on the user request, follow these detailed steps:\n\n1. **Understand the User Request:**\n   - The user wants to find ZTF objects that are within 1.5 arcseconds of a specific Solar System object identified as '115185'.\n   - The required output includes the ZTF identifier, the magnitude of the Solar System object from the MPC archive, and the distance between the ZTF object detection and the Solar System object.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Tables:**\n   - The main table for ZTF objects is `object`, which contains the ZTF identifiers and their coordinates.\n   - The `ss_ztf` table contains information about the closest known solar system objects, including the distance and magnitude of the Solar System object.\n\n3. **Define the Selection Criteria:**\n   - The query needs to filter ZTF objects based on their proximity to the Solar System object '115185'.\n   - The distance must be calculated using the Q3C functions to ensure that only objects within 1.5 arcseconds are included.\n\n4. **Determine the Required Columns:**\n   - From the `object` table, retrieve the ZTF identifier (oid).\n   - From the `ss_ztf` table, retrieve the magnitude (ssmagnr) of the Solar System object.\n   - Calculate the distance between the ZTF object and the Solar System object using the appropriate Q3C function.\n\n5. **Formulate the Query Structure:**\n   - Start with a `SELECT` statement to specify the columns to be returned: ZTF identifier, MPC archive magnitude, and the calculated distance.\n   - Use a `JOIN` clause to combine the `object` table and the `ss_ztf` table based on the common identifier (oid).\n   - Apply a `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include the Solar System object with the name '115185'.\n   - Use the Q3C function to calculate the distance between the coordinates of the ZTF objects and the coordinates of the Solar System object, ensuring that the distance is less than or equal to 1.5 arcseconds.\n\n6. **Sort the Results:**\n   - Use an `ORDER BY` clause to sort the results by the calculated distance in ascending order.\n\n7. **Document the Query:**\n   - Write comments within the SQL code to explain the purpose of each part of the query, such as the filtering criteria and the calculations performed.\n   - Create external documentation that describes the query's purpose, the information it retrieves, and any assumptions or limitations.\n\nBy following these steps, you will be able to construct a PostgreSQL query that accurately retrieves the desired information from the ALeRCE database.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''For the Solar System object called '115185' in the MPC archive, find all ZTF objects that lie within 1.5 arcsec from it.
