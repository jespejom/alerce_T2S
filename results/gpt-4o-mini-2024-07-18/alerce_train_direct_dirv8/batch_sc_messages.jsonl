This database serves as a repository for information about individual spatial objects, encompassing various statistics, properties, detections, and features observed by survey telescopes.\nThe tables within the database are categorized into three types: time and band independent (e.g., object, probability), time-independent (e.g., magstats), and time and band-dependent (e.g., detection). Your role involves carefully analyzing user requests, considering the specifics of the given tables. It is crucial to pay attention to explicit conditions outlined by the user and always maintain awareness of the broader context.\nThe user values the personality of a knowledgeable SQL expert, so ensuring accuracy is paramount. Be thorough in understanding and addressing the user's request, taking into account both explicit conditions and the overall context for effective communication and assistance.\n\n\n# Correct a SQL query given the next user request:\nFor the Solar System object called '115185' in the MPC archive, find all ZTF objects that lie within 1.5 arcsec from it. Return the following columns, sort by distance: ZTF identifier, MPC archive magnitude, and distance between ZTF object detection and MPC object\n\n# These are the table schemas. Assume that only the following tables are required for the query:\n\nCREATE TABLE object ( /* this is the most important table. It contains the main statistics of an object, independent of time and band */\n    oid VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,  /* object identifier, from the ZTF */\n    deltajd DOUBLE PRECISION, /* time difference between last and first detection */\n    firstmjd DOUBLE PRECISION, /* time of first detection */\n    lastmjd DOUBLE PRECISION, /* time of last detection */\n    ndethist INTEGER,  /* number of posible detections above 3 sigma */\n    ncovhist INTEGER,  /* number of visits */\n    mjdstarthist DOUBLE PRECISION,  /* time of first observation even if not detected, Earliest Julian date of epoch corresponding to ndethist [days]*/\n    mjdendhist DOUBLE PRECISION, /* time of last observation even if not detected, Latest Julian date of epoch corresponding to ndethist [days] */\n    corrected BOOLEAN, /* whether the object was corrected */\n    stellar BOOLEAN, /* whether the object is likely psf shaped */\n    ndet INTEGER, /* total number of detections for the object */\n    g_r_max DOUBLE PRECISION, /* g-r difference color at maximum */\n    g_r_max_corr DOUBLE PRECISION, /* g-r color at maximum*/\n    g_r_mean DOUBLE PRECISION, /* mean g-r difference color */\n    g_r_mean_corr DOUBLE PRECISION, /* mean g-r color */\n    meanra DOUBLE PRECISION,  /* mean right ascension */\n    meandec DOUBLE PRECISION,  /* mean declination */\n    sigmara DOUBLE PRECISION, /* right ascension dispersion */\n    sigmadec DOUBLE PRECISION, /* declination dispersion */\n    step_id_corr VARCHAR, /* correction step pipeline version */\n    diffpos BOOLEAN, /* whether the first detection was positive or negative */\n    reference_change BOOLEAN /* whether the reference image changes */\n);\nCREATE TABLE ss_ztf ( /* this table contains information about the closest known solar system object */\n    oid VARCHAR REFERENCES object(oid),\n    candid BIGINT NOT NULL, /* unique candidate identifier */\n    ssdistnr DOUBLE PRECISION, /* distance to nearest known solar system object */\n    ssmagnr DOUBLE PRECISION, /* magnitude of nearest known solar system object */\n    ssnamenr VARCHAR /* name to nearest known solar system object.
