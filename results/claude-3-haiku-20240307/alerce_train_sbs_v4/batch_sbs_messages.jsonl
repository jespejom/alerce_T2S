Start with the `probability` table to get the classification information.\n   b. Add a `WHERE` clause to filter for 'SNIa' and 'CV/Nova' classes with the specified rankings.\n   c. Use an `INNER JOIN` with the `object` table to get the oid.\n   d. Add a `WHERE` clause to ensure the difference between the two probabilities is less than 0.1.\n   e. Select the necessary columns, renaming them as requested.\n\n4. **Construct the Query**:\n   - The query will start with the `probability` table to get the classification information.\n   - Add an `INNER JOIN` with the `object` table to get the oid.\n   - Use `WHERE` clauses to filter for the specific class names, rankings, and probability difference.\n   - Select the oid, the probability for 'SNIa' (named 'SN_prob'), and the probability for 'CV/Nova' (named 'CV_prob').\n\n5. **Document the Query**:\n   - Add comments to explain the purpose of each part of the query.\n   - Describe any assumptions or limitations of the query.\n\nThe final query will look something like this:\n\n```sql\n-- Retrieve object identifiers and probabilities for SNIa (rank 1) and CV/Nova (rank 2) in the lc_classifier\n-- where the difference between the probabilities is less than 0.1\nSELECT\n  o.oid,\n  p1.probability AS SN_prob,\n  p2.probability AS CV_prob\nFROM\n  probability p1\n  INNER JOIN probability p2 ON p1.oid = p2.oid\n  INNER JOIN object o ON p1.oid = o.oid\nWHERE\n  p1.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'\n  AND p1.class_name = 'SNIa'\n  AND p1.ranking = 1\n  AND p2.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'\n  AND p2.class_name = 'CV/Nova'\n  AND p2.ranking = 2\n  AND ABS(p1.probability - p2.probability) < 0.1\n```\n\nThis query first joins the `probability` table twice (with aliases `p1` and `p2`) to get the probabilities for the 'SNIa' and 'CV/Nova' classes, respectively. It then joins the `object` table to retrieve the oid. The `WHERE` clause filters for the specific class names, rankings, and the probability difference condition.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}]}}}

This plan provides a general outline of the steps required to generate the final query.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}]}}}

Start with a `SELECT` statement that retrieves the desired columns from the `object` and `probability` tables.\n   b. Use an `INNER JOIN` between the `object` and `probability` tables to link the object information with the classification probabilities.\n   c. Add a `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the user's requirements:\n      - `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`: This ensures we only consider the light curve classifier.\n      - `probability.class_name IN ('SNIa', 'SNIbc', 'SNII', 'SLSN')`: This filters the results to the requested classes.\n      - `probability.probability >= 0.2`: This applies the minimum probability threshold.\n   d. Order the results by the `probability.ranking` column to ensure the probabilities are returned in the correct order.\n\nThe detailed decomposition plan for the query would be:\n\n1. Select the following columns:\n   - `object.oid`\n   - `object.meanra`\n   - `object.meandec`\n   - `object.g_r_max`\n   - `object.g_r_mean_corr`\n   - `probability.class_name`\n   - `probability.probability`\n   - `probability.ranking`\n\n2. From the `object` table, joined with the `probability` table on `object.oid = probability.oid`.\n\n3. Add the following `WHERE` clauses:\n   - `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`\n   - `probability.class_name IN ('SNIa', 'SNIbc', 'SNII', 'SLSN')`\n   - `probability.probability >= 0.2`\n\n4. Order the results by `probability.ranking`.\n\nThis query will return all the classification probabilities (not just the top-ranked one) for the requested classes, along with the relevant object information, for objects that have a probability higher than 0.2 according to the light curve classifier.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

The key is to follow the steps outlined above and provide the necessary details and conditions to generate the optimal query.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}]}}}

Add the condition `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'` to use the light curve classifier.\n   c. Add the condition `probability.probability > 0.6` to filter the objects with probability greater than 0.6 for the 'SNII' class.\n   d. Add the condition `object.ndet > 50` to filter the objects with more than 50 detections.\n   e.

Create a subquery on the `probability` table to filter the objects classified as 'SNII' with probability greater than 0.6.\n   b. Join the `object` table with the `probability` subquery using an INNER JOIN.\n   c. Create a subquery on the `feature` table to retrieve the 'delta_mag_fid' feature for the g-band (fid = 1) where the value is greater than 2, joining with the `object` table from the previous step.\n   d.

Start with the `probability` table to filter for objects with a YSO classification probability greater than 0.7.\n   b. Join the `probability` table with the `object` table to access the object-level information.\n   c. Join the `feature` table to retrieve the relevant feature information (period and amplitude).\n   d. Apply the filters for the period (between 3 and 10 days) and amplitude (greater than 0.5 mag).\n   e. Sort the results in descending order by the probability.\n   f. Select the desired output columns: oid, probability, feature name, feature value, fid (filter id), and feature version.\n\nThe detailed steps to construct the query are as follows:\n\n1. **Filter for YSO Probability**: \n   - Start with the `probability` table and filter for rows where `class_name = 'YSO'` and `probability > 0.7`.\n   - This will give us the objects with a high probability of being YSOs.\n\n2. **Join with the `object` Table**:\n   - Join the filtered `probability` table with the `object` table on the `oid` column.\n   - This will allow us to access the object-level information, such as the photometric features.\n\n3. **Join with the `feature` Table**:\n   - Join the previous result with the `feature` table on the `oid` column.\n   - This will allow us to access the feature information, such as the photometric period and amplitude.\n\n4. **Apply Filters for Period and Amplitude**:\n   - Filter the results to include only objects where the `name` column in the `feature` table is 'Period_band' and the `value` is between 3 and 10 days.\n   - Also, filter for objects where the `name` column is 'Amplitude' and the `value` is greater than 0.5 mag.\n\n5. **Sort and Select Columns**:\n   - Sort the results in descending order by the `probability` column.\n   - Select the desired output columns: `oid`, `probability`, `name` (from `feature` table), `value` (from `feature` table), `fid` (from `feature` table), and `version` (from `feature` table).\n\nBy following these steps, you can generate the PostgreSQL query that fulfills the user's request to retrieve objects that are likely to be YSOs with specific photometric properties, sorted by the probability.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}]}}}

Create a subquery to get the top 1000 AGN and QSO candidates from the `probability` table:\n   - Select the `oid`, `probability`, `class_name` from the `probability` table.\n   - Filter the `class_name` to 'AGN' and 'QSO'.\n   - Filter the `probability` to be greater than 0.6 for 'AGN' and greater than 0.5 for 'QSO'.\n   - Order the results by `probability` in descending order.\n   - Limit the results to the top 1000 for each class.\n\n2. Join the subquery with the `object` table to retrieve the additional information:\n   - Perform an INNER JOIN between the subquery and the `object` table on the `oid` column.\n   - Select all columns from the `object` table and the `probability` and `class_name` columns from the subquery.\n\n3. Add a `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include objects with `ndet` between 30 and 200:\n   - Use the `WHERE` clause to filter the `ndet` column in the `object` table to be between 30 and 200.\n\n4. Order the final results by the `probability` column in descending order.\n\nBy following these steps, you can generate the PostgreSQL query that fulfills the user's request to retrieve the top 1000 AGN and QSO candidates with the specified probability thresholds and detection count range, ordered by probability in descending order.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}]}}}

Select the required columns from the `object`, `probability`, and `feature` tables.\n2. Join the `object` and `probability` tables on the `oid` column, and then join the resulting table with the `feature` table, also on the `oid` column.\n3. Add a `WHERE` clause to filter the objects based on the `object.firstmjd` column, where the value is between '2023-02-01' and '2023-02-02'.\n4. Add a `WHERE` clause to filter the objects based on the `probability.classifier_name` being 'lc_classifier' and `probability.ranking` being 1.\n5. Return the selected columns.\n\nThis query will retrieve the galactic coordinates, feature columns, class name, and object identifiers for the objects classified by the light curve classifier that were first detected between February 1 and 2 of 2023.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}]}}}

Select from the `probability` table where `class_name` is 'AGN', 'QSO', or 'Blazar', `classifier_name` is 'lc_classifier', and `ranking` is 1.\n2. Join the resulting table with the `object` table on `oid`.\n3. Filter the joined table to only include objects where `ndet` is greater than or equal to 30 and `lastmjd - firstmjd` is greater than or equal to 200.\n4. Filter the joined table to only include objects where `probability` is greater than 0.5.\n5. Select the desired columns: `oid`, `ndet`, `firstmjd`, `lastmjd`, `class_name`, `probability`.\n6. Order the results by `probability` in descending order.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

Then, filter the results to only include objects where the `probability.classifier_name` is 'stamp_classifier' and the `probability.probability` is greater than 0.5.\n\n4. **Filter by Number of Detections**: Add a condition to the query to include objects that have more than one detection (`object.ndet > 1`).\n\n5. **Select the Desired Columns**: Select the relevant columns from the `object` and `probability` tables, such as `oid`, `firstmjd`, `lastmjd`, `ndet`, `probability.probability`, and `probability.class_name`.\n\n6. **Order the Results**: Order the results by the `firstmjd` column to display the objects in chronological order.\n\nThe detailed steps to generate the PostgreSQL query are as follows:\n\n1. Start with the `object` table as the main table.\n2. Add a `WHERE` clause to filter the `firstmjd` and `lastmjd` columns to the given date range:\n   - `WHERE object.firstmjd >= 59816.0 AND object.lastmjd <= 59832.0`\n3.

For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}]}}}

For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}]}}}
