Summarize the USER's request:\n   The user is requesting the object identifiers (oids) and the probabilities for objects classified as SNIa with ranking 1 and CV/Nova with ranking 2 in the light curve classifier, where the difference between the probabilities at each ranking is less than 0.1. The probabilities should be returned with the column names 'SN_prob' and 'CV_prob' respectively.\n\n2. Interpret the main objectives of the query:\n   - Retrieve oids and probabilities for objects classified as SNIa (ranking 1) and CV/Nova (ranking 2) in the light curve classifier\n   - Filter for objects where the difference between the SNIa and CV/Nova probabilities is less than 0.1\n   - Return the oids and the probabilities with the specified column names\n\n3. Identify relevant tables and columns:\n   - Table: 'probability'\n   - Columns: 'oid', 'class_name', 'probability', 'ranking'\n\n4. List specific columns required:\n   - 'oid'\n   - 'probability' (with column aliases 'SN_prob' and 'CV_prob')\n\n5. Determine necessary conditions and filters:\n   - 'probability.class_name' in ('SNIa', 'CV/Nova')\n   - 'probability.ranking' in (1, 2)\n   - Difference between 'SN_prob' and 'CV_prob' < 0.1\n\n6. Consider spatial query requirements:\n   - No spatial queries are required in this case.\n\n7. Evaluate need for aggregations or groupings:\n   - No aggregations or groupings are needed.\n\n8. Optimize for simplicity and performance:\n   - The query can be kept simple and efficient by using a single subquery to retrieve the required data.\n\n9. Verify adherence to default conditions and naming conventions:\n   - The default condition of 'probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'' is already included.\n   - The column names match the database schema.\n\n10. Consider potential edge cases or error handling:\n    - If there are no objects matching the criteria, the query will return an empty result set.\n\n11.

The USER's request is to return a query for objects within 10 degrees of the given positions ('source_1' and 'source_2'), and with their first detection in the first 7 days of February.\n\n2. The relevant tables are 'OBJECT' and 'detection'. The key columns needed are:\n   - 'OBJECT': 'oid', 'meanra', 'meandec', 'firstmjd', 'ndet', 'g_r_mean', 'g_r_mean_corr', 'stellar', 'corrected', 'reference_change'\n\n3. The specific columns requested are:\n   - 'oid', 'meanra', 'meandec', 'firstmjd', 'ndet', 'g_r_mean', 'g_r_mean_corr', 'stellar', 'corrected', 'reference_change'\n\n4. The necessary conditions and filters are:\n   - Join 'OBJECT' table with the given source positions using the q3c_dist function to find objects within 10 degrees.\n   - Filter 'object.firstmjd' to be between the given dates for the first 7 days of February (59976.0 and 59982.0).\n\n5. No spatial query requirements, as the q3c_dist function is used to find objects within the given radius.\n\n6. No aggregations or groupings are needed for this query.\n\n7. The query is optimized for simplicity and performance by using a CTE (Common Table Expression) to define the source positions and then joining with the 'OBJECT' table.\n\n8. The default conditions and naming conventions are followed.\n\n9. No edge cases or error handling are considered in this specific query.\n\nThe final query structure is a single SELECT statement with an INNER JOIN between the 'OBJECT' table and the CTE containing the source positions, filtered by the 'firstmjd' date range.]\n(Background on this error at: https://sqlalche.me/e/20/f405)"
