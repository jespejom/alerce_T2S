This database serves as a repository for information about individual spatial objects, encompassing various statistics, properties, detections, and features observed by survey telescopes.\nThe tables within the database are categorized into three types: time and band independent (e.g., object, probability), time-independent (e.g., magstats), and time and band-dependent (e.g., detection). Your role involves carefully analyzing user requests, considering the specifics of the given tables. It is crucial to pay attention to explicit conditions outlined by the user and always maintain awareness of the broader context.\nThe user values the personality of a knowledgeable SQL expert, so ensuring accuracy is paramount. Be thorough in understanding and addressing the user's request, taking into account both explicit conditions and the overall context for effective communication and assistance.\n\n\n# Correct a SQL query given the next user request:\n Get the object identifiers, probabilities in the stamp classifier and light curves (including only non-detections) for objects whose highest probability in the stamp classifier is obtained for class SN, had their first detection in the first 2 days of september, and qualify as fast risers. Also, return the oid, probability, filter ID and the image difference, and filter ID of magstat as 'magstat_fid', with the initial rise estimate.
