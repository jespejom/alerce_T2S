Alternatively, use the `feature` table to identify objects with no variability in the g band.\n   - Look for the feature `ExcessVar` in the g band (`fid = 1`).\n   - Filter objects where `feature.value = 0` to ensure no variability in the g band.\n3. Combine the results of the two conditions (no detections or no variability) using a `UNION` operation to retrieve the `oid` of objects that meet either condition.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Combine results to find objects meeting all conditions**\n1.

The query involves retrieving objects classified as AGN, filtering based on variability in the r band, and excluding objects with detections or variability in the g band. Additionally, the results need to be ordered by feature values and object IDs. Below is the detailed decomposition plan:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Filter objects classified as AGN**\n1. Use the `probability` table to filter objects classified as 'AGN' by the `lc_classifier` classifier.\n   - Add the condition `probability.class_name = 'AGN'`.\n   - Add the default condition `probability.ranking = 1` to ensure only the most likely classification is considered.\n   - Add the default condition `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identify objects showing variability in the r band**\n1. Use the `feature` table to identify objects with variability in the r band.\n   - The feature indicating variability is `ExcessVar`, which measures intrinsic variability amplitude.\n   - Filter rows where `feature.name = 'ExcessVar'` and `feature.fid = 2` (r band).\n   - Add a condition to ensure variability, e.g., `feature.value > 0` (positive variability).\n   - Use an INNER JOIN with the filtered `probability` sub-query from Step 1 to ensure only AGN-classified objects are considered.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Exclude objects with detections or variability in the g band**\n1. Use the `feature` table to exclude objects with detections or variability in the g band.\n   - For detections in the g band:\n     - Use the feature `n_det` (number of detections) with `feature.name = 'n_det'` and `feature.fid = 1` (g band).\n     - Add a condition to exclude objects with detections, e.g., `feature.value > 0`.\n   - For variability in the g band:\n     - Use the feature `ExcessVar` with `feature.name = 'ExcessVar'` and `feature.fid = 1` (g band).\n     - Add a condition to exclude objects with variability, e.g., `feature.value > 0`.\n   - Create sub-queries for each feature (`n_det` and `ExcessVar`) and use an INNER JOIN with the filtered `probability` sub-query from Step 1 to ensure only AGN-classified objects are considered.\n   - Use a UNION between the sub-queries for `n_det` and `ExcessVar` to combine the exclusion criteria.\n   - Use an INTERSECT between the AGN objects from Step 1 and the UNION query to exclude objects with detections or variability in the g band.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Combine results for AGN objects with variability in r band but no detections or variability in g band**\n1. Use the results from Step 2 (AGN objects with variability in r band) and Step 3 (objects to exclude) to filter the final set of objects.\n   - Use an INTERSECT between the results of Step 2 and the complement of Step 3 to retain only objects that meet the criteria.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Retrieve features and order results**\n1. Retrieve all features for the filtered objects from Step 4.\n   - Use the `feature` table and filter rows where `feature.oid` matches the filtered object IDs from Step 4.\n   - Order the features by `feature.value` in ascending order.\n2. Order the final query results by `object.oid` in ascending order.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Final Query Construction**\n1. Combine all the sub-queries and conditions into a single query.\n2.

Use the `feature` table to identify objects with detections or variability in the g band (`fid = 1`).\n   - Look for the feature `n_det` (number of detections) in the g band and ensure its value is greater than 0 to identify objects with detections.\n   - Look for the feature `ExcessVar` in the g band and ensure its value is greater than 0 to identify objects with variability.\n2. Create two sub-queries:\n   - One sub-query to retrieve `oid` of objects with `n_det > 0` in the g band.\n   - Another sub-query to retrieve `oid` of objects with `ExcessVar > 0` in the g band.\n3.

The query involves multiple tables (`object`, `probability`, `feature`, and `detection`), conditions, and calculations. Below is the detailed decomposition plan:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Filter objects classified as AGN with a probability larger than 0.6**\n1. Use the `probability` table to filter objects (`oid`) classified as 'AGN' by the `lc_classifier` classifier.\n   - Conditions:\n     - `probability.class_name = 'AGN'`\n     - `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`\n     - `probability.ranking = 1` (default condition for the `probability` table).\n     - `probability.probability > 0.6`\n2. Create a sub-query to retrieve the `oid` of objects meeting these conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Filter objects with light curves covering at least one year**\n1. Use the `object` table to filter objects whose light curves span at least one year.\n   - Condition:\n     - `object.deltajd >= 365` (time difference between the last and first detection in days).\n2. Create a sub-query to retrieve the `oid` of objects meeting this condition.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Filter objects with at least 20 detections in at least one band**\n1. Use the `feature` table to filter objects with at least 20 detections in any band.\n   - Feature name: `n_det`\n   - Condition:\n     - `feature.name = 'n_det'`\n     - `feature.value >= 20`\n2. Create a sub-query to retrieve the `oid` of objects meeting this condition.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Filter objects with variations larger than 1 magnitude in the g band and larger than 0.5 in the r band**\n1. Use the `feature` table to filter objects based on magnitude variations in the g and r bands.\n   - Feature names:\n     - `delta_mag_fid` (difference between maximum and minimum observed magnitude in a given band).\n   - Conditions:\n     - For the g band:\n       - `feature.name = 'delta_mag_fid'`\n       - `feature.fid = 1` (g band filter ID).\n       - `feature.value > 1`\n     - For the r band:\n       - `feature.name = 'delta_mag_fid'`\n       - `feature.fid = 2` (r band filter ID).\n       - `feature.value > 0.5`\n2. Create two sub-queries:\n   - One for the g band condition.\n   - One for the r band condition.\n3. Use an `INTERSECT` operation to retrieve the `oid` of objects meeting both conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Combine all filters to retrieve the final set of objects**\n1. Use the sub-queries from Steps 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n2. Combine the sub-queries using `INTERSECT` to retrieve the `oid` of objects that satisfy all conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Retrieve required information for the filtered objects**\n1. Use the `object` table to retrieve the following columns:\n   - `oid`\n   - `meanra` (mean right ascension)\n   - `meandec` (mean declination)\n   - `ndet` (number of detections)\n2. Use the `feature` table to retrieve the following columns:\n   - `name` (feature name)\n   - `value` (feature value)\n   - `version` (feature version)\n   - `fid` (filter ID, alias as `feature_fid`).\n3. Use the `detection` table to calculate the maximum and minimum corrected magnitudes for the g and r bands:\n   - Conditions:\n     - `detection.fid = 1` (g band) or `detection.fid = 2` (r band).\n   - Columns:\n     - Maximum corrected magnitude: `MAX(detection.magpsf_corr)`\n     - Minimum corrected magnitude: `MIN(detection.magpsf_corr)`\n     - Magnitude variation (alias as `delta_mag`): `MAX(detection.magpsf_corr) - MIN(detection.magpsf_corr)`\n4. Use `INNER JOIN` operations to combine the `object`, `feature`, and `detection` tables based on the `oid`.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Apply aliases and formatting**\n1. Alias the `fid` column from the `feature` table as `feature_fid`.\n2. Alias the magnitude variation columns as `delta_mag`.\n3. Ensure all required columns are included in the final result.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Final query structure**\n1. Use the sub-query from Step 5 to filter the objects.\n2. Use `INNER JOIN` operations to retrieve the required columns from the `object`, `feature`, and `detection` tables.\n3. Apply the necessary conditions and calculations for the maximum, minimum, and variation in magnitudes.\n4.

Calculate the rate of magnitude change (`dm/dt`) for each object:\n   - Compute the difference in magnitude (`dm = diffmaglim - magpsf`) and divide it by the time difference (`dt = firstmjd - mjd`).\n   - Filter objects where `dm/dt >= 0.25` (to identify fast risers).\n4. Retrieve the `oid`, `fid`, `dm/dt`, and other relevant details for these objects.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Combine the filters from Steps 1, 2, and 3**\n1. Perform an `INNER JOIN` between the results of Step 1 (objects classified as 'SN') and Step 2 (objects with first detection in early September) to get the common `oid`.\n2.

Retrieve the `oid`, `probability` (from Step 1), `fid`, and `dm/dt` (from Step 3).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Retrieve light curves (detections and non-detections)**\n1. Use the `detection` table to retrieve light curve data for the filtered objects:\n   - Filter by `oid` from Step 4.\n   - Retrieve `mjd`, `fid`, `magpsf`, `sigmapsf`, and other relevant columns.\n2. Use the `non_detection` table to retrieve non-detection data for the filtered objects:\n   - Filter by `oid` from Step 4.\n   - Retrieve `mjd`, `fid`, and `diffmaglim`.\n3. Combine the detection and non-detection data using a `UNION` query.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Retrieve additional details from the `magstat` table**\n1. Use the `magstat` table to retrieve additional statistics for the filtered objects:\n   - Filter by `oid` from Step 4.\n   - Retrieve `fid` (as `magstat_fid`), `magmean`, `magmedian`, `magmax`, `magmin`, and other relevant columns.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Combine all results**\n1. Perform an `INNER JOIN` between the results of Step 4 (filtered objects) and Step 5 (light curves) to associate light curve data with the filtered objects.\n2. Perform another `INNER JOIN` with the results of Step 6 (magstat data) to include additional statistics.\n3. Retrieve the following columns:\n   - `oid` (object identifier).\n   - `probability` (from Step 1).\n   - `fid` (filter ID from light curves).\n   - `magstat_fid` (filter ID from `magstat`).\n   - `dm/dt` (initial rise estimate from Step 3).\n   - Light curve data (detections and non-detections).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Order and limit the results**\n1. Order the results by `oid` in ascending order.\n2. Limit the results to 100 rows to meet the time constraints.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 9: Final Query Validation**\n1. Ensure all default conditions are applied:\n   - `probability.ranking = 1`.\n   - `probability.classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`.\n2. Verify that all required columns are included in the final output.\n3.

Include only rows where either:\n     - `sgscore1 < 0.5`, or\n     - `distpsnr1 < 1`.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: **Join the Tables**\n- Use an `INNER JOIN` between the `detection` and `ps1_ztf` tables on the `oid` column to combine the required information.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: **Select the Required Columns**\n- From the `detection` table:\n  - `oid`, `candid`, `fid`, `mjd`, `magpsf`, `sigmapsf`, `has_stamp`, `drb`.\n- From the `ps1_ztf` table:\n  - `sgscore1`, `distpsnr1`.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: **Order the Results**\n- If the user does not specify an order, do not apply any specific sorting.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: **Construct the Query**\n- Combine all the above steps into a single query:\n  1. Use a `WITH` clause to define the list of `oids` as a temporary table.\n  2. Perform an `INNER JOIN` between the `detection` and `ps1_ztf` tables.\n  3. Apply the filtering conditions in the `WHERE` clause.\n  4. Select the required columns.\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: **Test the Query**\n- Validate the query to ensure it retrieves the correct data and adheres to the specified conditions.\n\n---\n\nBy following these steps, you can systematically construct the PostgreSQL query to retrieve the requested information.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3504, "completion_tokens": 756, "total_tokens": 4260, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 3456, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_f0e307537d"}}, "error": null}

Below is the detailed decomposition plan:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Define the Input Objects and Their Search Parameters**\n1. Create a temporary inline table using the `WITH` clause to define the input objects (`id_1` and `id_2`) and their associated coordinates and search radii.\n   - For `id_1`: RA = 354.67, Dec = 15.954, and search radius = 30 arcsec (0.008333 degrees).\n   - For `id_2`: RA = 20.7993, Dec = 1.00331, and search radius = 20 arcsec (0.005556 degrees).\n   - The table should include columns: `identifier`, `ra`, `dec`, and `search_radius`.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Perform Spatial Filtering for Each Input Object**\n1. Use the `q3c_radial_query` function to filter ZTF objects from the `object` table that lie within the specified search radius of each input object.\n   - For `id_1`, filter objects within 0.008333 degrees of (RA, Dec) = (354.67, 15.954).\n   - For `id_2`, filter objects within 0.005556 degrees of (RA, Dec) = (20.7993, 1.00331).\n2.

Use a `UNION` operation to combine the results of the two subqueries from Step 2.\n   - Ensure that the combined result includes the ZTF object identifier (`oid`), number of detections (`ndet`), mean RA (`meanra`), mean Dec (`meandec`), and first detection date (`firstmjd`).\n   - Add a column to indicate the input object (`id_1` or `id_2`) that each ZTF object is associated with.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Retrieve Input Object Information**\n1. Create a subquery to retrieve the input object information from the temporary inline table created in Step 1.\n   - Include columns: `identifier`, `ra`, `dec`, and `search_radius`.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Combine Input and Output Information**\n1. Use a `JOIN` operation to combine the input object information (from Step 4) with the ZTF object results (from Step 3).\n   - Match the input object identifier (`identifier`) with the associated column in the ZTF object results.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Sort the Results**\n1. Sort the combined results by the last detection date (`lastmjd`) in descending order.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Final Output**\n1. Ensure the final output includes the following columns:\n   - For the input objects: `identifier`, `ra`, `dec`, and `search_radius`.\n   - For the output ZTF objects: `oid`, `ndet`, `meanra`, `meandec`, and `firstmjd`.\n2.

Retrieve input object information from the temporary inline table.\n5. Combine input and output information using a `JOIN`.\n6. Sort the results by `lastmjd` in descending order.\n7.

Use a `CASE` statement or a join with the temporary inline table (created in Step 1) to associate each ZTF object with the input object that matched it.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Finalize the Query**\n1. Combine all the results into a single query:\n   - Use the `WITH` clause to define the temporary inline table for the input objects.\n   - Perform the spatial filtering for each input object using `q3c_radial_query`.\n   - Combine the results of the spatial searches using `UNION`.\n   - Retrieve the required columns for both the input objects and the output ZTF objects.\n   - Sort the results by `lastmjd` in descending order.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Validate the Query**\n1.

This table will include:\n   - `source_id`: Identifier of the input objects (`id_1` and `id_2`).\n   - `ra`: Right Ascension of the input objects (354.67 for `id_1` and 20.7993 for `id_2`).\n   - `dec`: Declination of the input objects (15.954 for `id_1` and 1.00331 for `id_2`).\n   - `radius`: Search radius in degrees (30 arcsec = 0.008333 degrees for `id_1` and 20 arcsec = 0.005556 degrees for `id_2`).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Perform Spatial Filtering for Each Input Object**\n1. Use the `q3c_radial_query` function to filter ZTF objects from the `object` table that lie within the specified search radius of each input object.\n   - For `id_1`, filter objects within 0.008333 degrees of (354.67, 15.954).\n   - For `id_2`, filter objects within 0.005556 degrees of (20.7993, 1.00331).\n2. Create two subqueries, one for each input object, to retrieve the ZTF objects that satisfy the spatial filtering conditions. Each subquery should:\n   - Select the ZTF object identifier (`oid`), number of detections (`ndet`), mean RA (`meanra`), mean Dec (`meandec`), and first detection date (`firstmjd`) from the `object` table.\n   - Include the `source_id` of the input object to associate the results with the corresponding input object.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Combine Results from Both Spatial Searches**\n1. Use a `UNION` operation to combine the results of the two subqueries from Step 2. This will create a single result set containing all ZTF objects that satisfy the spatial filtering conditions for either `id_1` or `id_2`.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Add Input Object Information to the Results**\n1. Join the combined results from Step 3 with the temporary inline table created in Step 1. This will add the input object information (`source_id`, `ra`, `dec`, and `radius`) to the output.\n   - Use an `INNER JOIN` on the `source_id` column to associate each ZTF object with the corresponding input object.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Select and Format the Required Columns**\n1. Select the following columns for the final output:\n   - For the input objects: `source_id` (identifier), `ra` (coordinates), `dec` (coordinates), and `radius` (search radius in degrees).\n   - For the output ZTF objects: `oid` (ZTF identifier), `ndet` (number of detections), `meanra` (mean RA), `meandec` (mean Dec), and `firstmjd` (first detection date).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Sort the Results**\n1. Sort the final result set by the `lastmjd` column (last detection date) in descending order. This ensures that the most recently detected objects appear first in the output.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Return the Final Query**\n1. Ensure the query is optimized and adheres to the database schema and conditions provided in the general context.\n2. Verify that the query includes all required columns and filters, and that it uses the Q3C functions correctly for spatial filtering.\n\n---\n\nBy following these steps, the query will retrieve all ZTF objects that lie within the specified angular distances of the input objects, include the required columns for both input and output objects, and sort the results by the last detection date in descending order.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2900, "completion_tokens": 898, "total_tokens": 3798, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 2176, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_f0e307537d"}}, "error": null}

The query involves filtering objects based on conditions from multiple tables (`object`, `probability`, and `ps1_ztf`), applying specific constraints, and ordering the results. Below is the detailed decomposition plan:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Filter objects based on the distance to the nearest PS1 source**\n1. Use the `ps1_ztf` table to filter objects where the distance to the nearest PS1 source (`distpsnr1`) is greater than 5 arcseconds.\n   - The condition is: `ps1_ztf.distpsnr1 > 5`.\n\n2. Ensure that the `oid` column from the `ps1_ztf` table is retained for further filtering and joining with other tables.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Filter objects based on classification probability**\n1. Use the `probability` table to filter objects that satisfy the following conditions:\n   - The `probability.ranking` is 1 (default condition for the `probability` table).\n   - The `probability.classifier_name` is `'lc_classifier'` (default condition for the `probability` table).\n   - The `probability.probability` is greater than 0.7.\n   - The `probability.class_name` is **not** one of the supernova classes (`'SNIa'`, `'SNIbc'`, `'SNII'`, `'SLSN'`).\n\n2. Retain the `oid` column from the `probability` table for further filtering and joining with other tables.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Combine the results from Step 1 and Step 2**\n1. Perform an `INNER JOIN` between the filtered results from the `ps1_ztf` table (Step 1) and the `probability` table (Step 2) using the `oid` column as the key.\n   - This ensures that only objects satisfying both conditions (distance and probability) are retained.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Retrieve all columns from the `object`, `probability`, and `ps1_ztf` tables**\n1. Use the `object` table to retrieve all columns for the filtered `oid` values.\n   - Perform an `INNER JOIN` between the `object` table and the combined results from Step 3 using the `oid` column as the key.\n\n2. Include all columns from the `object`, `probability`, and `ps1_ztf` tables in the final result.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Apply the limit and ordering**\n1.

Use the `oid` column as the key for the join.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Retrieve all columns from the `object`, `probability`, and `ps1_ztf` tables**\n1. Use the `oid` values obtained in Step 3 to retrieve all columns from the `object`, `probability`, and `ps1_ztf` tables.\n2. Perform `INNER JOIN` operations between the `object`, `probability`, and `ps1_ztf` tables using the `oid` column as the key.\n3. Ensure that the `probability` table is filtered with the default conditions (`ranking = 1` and `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`) as specified in the general context.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Order the results by the nearest PS1 source distance**\n1. Use the `distpsnr1` column from the `ps1_ztf` table to order the results in ascending order (smallest distance first).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Limit the number of results to 200**\n1. Apply a `LIMIT` clause to restrict the output to at most 200 rows.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of the Query Plan**\n1. **Subquery 1 (Filter by PS1 distance):** Select `oid` values from the `ps1_ztf` table where `distpsnr1 > 5`.\n2. **Subquery 2 (Filter by classification probability):** Select `oid` values from the `probability` table where:\n   - `ranking = 1`\n   - `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`\n   - `probability > 0.7`\n   - `class_name NOT IN ('SNIa', 'SNIbc', 'SNII', 'SLSN')`.\n3. **Combine Subqueries:** Perform an `INNER JOIN` between the results of Subquery 1 and Subquery 2 to get the `oid` values that satisfy both conditions.\n4. **Retrieve Data:** Use the `oid` values from the combined subquery to retrieve all columns from the `object`, `probability`, and `ps1_ztf` tables using `INNER JOIN` operations.\n5. **Order Results:** Sort the results by the `distpsnr1` column in ascending order.\n6. **Limit Results:** Restrict the output to at most 200 rows.\n\n---\n\nThis detailed decomposition ensures that the query is accurate, efficient, and adheres to the conditions specified in the user request and the general context.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3785, "completion_tokens": 966, "total_tokens": 4751, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 1664, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_f0e307537d"}}, "error": null}

The query involves filtering objects based on conditions from multiple tables (`object`, `probability`, and `ps1_ztf`), applying specific constraints, and ordering the results. Below is the detailed decomposition plan:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Filter objects based on the distance to the nearest PS1 source**\n1. Identify the relevant column in the `ps1_ztf` table that represents the distance to the nearest PS1 source. This column is `distpsnr1`.\n2. Apply the condition that the distance to the nearest PS1 source (`distpsnr1`) must be greater than 5 arcseconds.\n3. Use the `ps1_ztf` table to filter objects (`oid`) that satisfy this condition.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Filter objects based on classification probability**\n1. Use the `probability` table to filter objects (`oid`) that meet the following conditions:\n   - The `probability` value must be greater than 0.7.\n   - The `class_name` must not correspond to any supernova class. Supernova classes in the `lc_classifier` are: `'SNIa'`, `'SNIbc'`, `'SNII'`, and `'SLSN'`. Therefore, exclude these classes.\n   - The `classifier_name` must be `'lc_classifier'` (as per the default condition for the `probability` table).\n   - The `ranking` must be 1 (as per the default condition for the `probability` table).\n2. Create a subquery to retrieve the `oid` values that satisfy these conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Combine the results from Step 1 and Step 2**\n1. Perform an `INNER JOIN` between the filtered results from the `ps1_ztf` table (Step 1) and the filtered results from the `probability` table (Step 2) using the `oid` column. This ensures that only objects satisfying both conditions are included.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Retrieve all columns from the `object`, `probability`, and `ps1_ztf` tables**\n1. Use the `oid` values obtained from Step 3 to retrieve all columns from the `object`, `probability`, and `ps1_ztf` tables.\n2. Perform `INNER JOIN` operations between the `object`, `probability`, and `ps1_ztf` tables using the `oid` column to combine the data.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Apply the limit and ordering**\n1. Order the results by the `distpsnr1` column in ascending order (as the user wants the results ordered by the nearest PS1 source distance).\n2. Limit the number of results to at most 200 objects.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Final Query Structure**\n1. The final query will consist of nested subqueries:\n   - A subquery to filter objects based on the `distpsnr1` condition (Step 1).\n   - A subquery to filter objects based on the `probability` conditions (Step 2).\n   - A main query that combines the results from the above subqueries and retrieves all columns from the `object`, `probability`, and `ps1_ztf` tables (Step 4).\n   - The main query will include the ordering and limit conditions (Step 5).\n\n---\n\n### **Additional Notes**\n- Ensure that the default conditions for the `probability` table are applied:\n  - `ranking = 1`\n  - `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`\n- Use `INNER JOIN` operations to combine data from multiple tables based on the `oid` column.\n- Exclude supernova classes (`'SNIa'`, `'SNIbc'`, `'SNII'`, `'SLSN'`) explicitly in the `probability` table filter.\n- Use the `distpsnr1` column from the `ps1_ztf` table for both filtering and ordering.\n- Return all columns from the `object`, `probability`, and `ps1_ztf` tables in the final result.\n\nThis detailed decomposition ensures that the query is accurate, efficient, and adheres to the database schema and user requirements.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3785, "completion_tokens": 900, "total_tokens": 4685, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 2304, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_f0e307537d"}}, "error": null}

Perform an `INNER JOIN` between the results of Step 1 (filtered `oid` values from `ps1_ztf`) and Step 2 (filtered `oid` values from `probability`) to identify objects that satisfy both conditions.\n2. The resulting `oid` values represent objects that:\n   - Have a distance to the nearest PS1 source larger than 5 arcsec.\n   - Have a probability greater than 0.7 of being in a class other than supernova in the light curve classifier.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Retrieve all columns from the `object`, `probability`, and `ps1_ztf` tables**\n1.

Use the `distpsnr1` column from the `ps1_ztf` table to order the results in ascending order (smallest distance first).\n2. Limit the number of results to at most 200 objects using the `LIMIT` clause.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Final Query Construction**\n1. Combine all the steps into a single query using subqueries and `INNER JOIN` operations.\n2. Ensure that all conditions are applied correctly:\n   - Distance condition (`distpsnr1 > 5`) from the `ps1_ztf` table.\n   - Probability conditions (`probability.ranking = 1`, `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`, `probability.probability > 0.7`, and `class_name NOT IN ('SNIa', 'SNIbc', 'SNII', 'SLSN')`) from the `probability` table.\n3.

This will be used to filter objects with a first detection date later than `mjd=60310`.\n- The `probability` table contains the `class_name`, `classifier_name`, `probability`, and `ranking` columns. These will be used to filter objects classified as 'asteroid' with a probability of 1 by the `stamp_classifier`.\n- The `forced_photometry` table contains all the columns that need to be returned for the filtered objects.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Apply the default conditions for the `probability` table\n- Use the default condition `probability.ranking = 1` to ensure only the most likely classifications are considered.\n- Use the condition `probability.classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'` to filter classifications made by the stamp classifier.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Filter objects based on the first detection date\n- Use the `object.firstmjd` column to filter objects with a first detection date later than `mjd=60310`.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Filter objects classified as 'asteroid' with a probability of 1\n- Use the `probability.class_name = 'asteroid'` condition to select objects classified as 'asteroid'.\n- Use the `probability.probability = 1` condition to ensure the classification probability is exactly 1.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Join the `object` and `probability` tables\n- Perform an `INNER JOIN` between the `object` and `probability` tables using the `oid` column, which is the unique object identifier. This will allow filtering objects based on both the first detection date and classification conditions.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Join the result with the `forced_photometry` table\n- Perform an `INNER JOIN` between the filtered results from the previous step and the `forced_photometry` table using the `oid` column. This will allow retrieving all columns from the `forced_photometry` table for the filtered objects.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Limit the number of results\n- Use the `LIMIT` clause to restrict the query to at most 10 results.\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: Order the results by the first detection date\n- Use the `ORDER BY object.firstmjd ASC` clause to sort the results in ascending order of the first detection date.\n\n---\n\n### Final Query Plan Summary\n1. Start with the `object` table and filter objects with `firstmjd > 60310`.\n2. Join the `object` table with the `probability` table on `oid` and apply the following conditions:\n   - `probability.ranking = 1`\n   - `probability.classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`\n   - `probability.class_name = 'asteroid'`\n   - `probability.probability = 1`\n3. Join the filtered results with the `forced_photometry` table on `oid`.\n4. Select all columns from the `forced_photometry` table.\n5. Order the results by `object.firstmjd` in ascending order.\n6.

Only include probabilities with `ranking = 1` for the light curve classifier (`classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: **Identify Relevant Tables**\n- The required information is distributed across the following tables:\n  1. **`object` table**: Contains the ZTF object identifiers (`oid`).\n  2. **`detection` table**: Contains information about detections, including the filter identifier (`fid`), dubious corrections (`dubious`), and the object identifier (`oid`).\n  3. **`probability` table**: Contains classification probabilities, including the class name (`class_name`), classifier version (`classifier_version`), probability (`probability`), and ranking (`ranking`).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: **Filter Conditions**\n- Apply the following conditions to filter the data:\n  1. In the `detection` table:\n     - Filter for detections in the g band (`fid = 1`).\n     - Filter for non-dubious corrections (`dubious = FALSE`).\n     - Group by `oid` and count the number of detections.

The query involves multiple tables (`probability`, `ss_ztf`, and `detection`) and requires filtering, joining, and selecting specific columns. Below is the detailed decomposition plan:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: **Filter the `probability` table for asteroid classification**\n1. Start by filtering the `probability` table to retrieve objects classified as 'asteroid' with the following conditions:\n   - `probability.classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'` (to use the stamp classifier).\n   - `probability.classifier_version = 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'` (to use the specified version of the classifier).\n   - `probability.class_name = 'asteroid'` (to select objects classified as asteroids).\n   - `probability.probability > 0.9` (to ensure the probability is greater than 0.9).\n   - `probability.ranking = 1` (to only consider the most likely classification for each object).\n\n2. Select the `oid` (object identifier) from this filtered result, as it will be used to join with other tables.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: **Join with the `ss_ztf` table to retrieve Solar System object information**\n1. Use the `oid` from the filtered `probability` table to join with the `ss_ztf` table. This will allow us to retrieve the following columns:\n   - `ss_ztf.ssdistnr` (distance to the nearest Solar System object).\n   - `ss_ztf.ssmagnr` (magnitude of the nearest Solar System object).\n   - `ss_ztf.ssnamenr` (name of the nearest Solar System object).\n\n2. Ensure that the join is an `INNER JOIN` to only include objects that exist in both tables.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: **Join with the `detection` table to retrieve candidate-related information**\n1. Use the `oid` from the filtered `probability` table to join with the `detection` table. This will allow us to retrieve the following columns related to each candidate:\n   - `detection.candid` (unique candidate identifier).\n   - `detection.fid` (filter identifier).\n   - `detection.fwhm` (Full Width at Half Maximum from SExtractor).\n   - `detection.ncalib` (number of PS1 calibrators used).\n   - `detection.exptime` (exposure time).\n\n2. Ensure that the join is an `INNER JOIN` to only include objects that exist in both tables.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: **Combine the results and limit the output**\n1. Combine the results from the `probability`, `ss_ztf`, and `detection` tables into a single output table.\n2. Select the following columns for the final output:\n   - From the `probability` table: `oid` (identifier of the ZTF object).\n   - From the `ss_ztf` table: `ssdistnr`, `ssmagnr`, and `ssnamenr`.\n   - From the `detection` table: `candid`, `fid`, `fwhm`, `ncalib`, and `exptime`.\n\n3. Limit the number of rows in the output to at most 30 objects.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: **Order the results (optional)**\n1. If the user does not specify an explicit ordering, you can choose a default ordering. For example:\n   - Order by `probability.probability` in descending order (to prioritize the highest probabilities).\n   - Alternatively, order by `detection.mjd` (Modified Julian Date) in descending order to prioritize the most recent detections.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: **Apply default conditions**\n1. Ensure that the default conditions for the `probability` table are applied:\n   - `probability.ranking = 1`.\n   - `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'` (if not explicitly overridden by the user, but in this case, the user specified `stamp_classifier`).\n\n2. Verify that all table and column names match the database schema exactly.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: **Test and validate the query**\n1. Test the query on a small subset of the database to ensure it retrieves the correct results.\n2. Validate that the output includes all requested columns and adheres to the specified conditions.\n\n---\n\nBy following these steps, you can systematically construct the SQL query to retrieve the requested information from the ALeRCE database.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3267, "completion_tokens": 965, "total_tokens": 4232, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 3200, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_f0e307537d"}}, "error": null}

The query involves multiple tables (`probability`, `ss_ztf`, and `detection`) and requires filtering, joining, and selecting specific columns. Below is the detailed decomposition plan:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: **Filter the `probability` table for asteroid classification**\n1. Start by filtering the `probability` table to retrieve objects classified as 'asteroid' with the following conditions:\n   - `probability.classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'` (to use the stamp classifier).\n   - `probability.classifier_version = 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'` (to use the specified version of the classifier).\n   - `probability.class_name = 'asteroid'` (to select objects classified as asteroids).\n   - `probability.probability > 0.9` (to ensure the probability is greater than 0.9).\n   - `probability.ranking = 1` (to only consider the most likely classification for each object).\n\n2. Select the `oid` (object identifier) from this filtered result, as it will be used to join with other tables.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: **Join with the `ss_ztf` table to retrieve Solar System object information**\n1. Use the `oid` values from the filtered `probability` table to join with the `ss_ztf` table. This will allow us to retrieve the following columns:\n   - `ss_ztf.ssdistnr` (distance to the nearest Solar System object).\n   - `ss_ztf.ssmagnr` (MPC archive magnitude of the nearest Solar System object).\n   - `ss_ztf.ssnamenr` (name of the nearest Solar System object).\n   - `ss_ztf.candid` (candidate identifier).\n\n2. Perform an `INNER JOIN` between the filtered `probability` table and the `ss_ztf` table using the `oid` column as the key.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: **Join with the `detection` table to retrieve candidate-related information**\n1. Use the `candid` values from the `ss_ztf` table to join with the `detection` table. This will allow us to retrieve the following columns related to each candidate:\n   - `detection.fid` (filter identifier).\n   - `detection.fwhm` (FWHM from SExtractor).\n   - `detection.ncalib` (number of PS1 calibrators used).\n   - `detection.exptime` (exposure time).\n\n2. Perform an `INNER JOIN` between the `ss_ztf` table and the `detection` table using the `candid` column as the key.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: **Limit the number of results**\n1. Use the `LIMIT` clause to restrict the output to at most 30 rows, as specified in the user request.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: **Select the required columns**\n1. From the joined tables, select the following columns for the final output:\n   - From the `ss_ztf` table:\n     - `ss_ztf.oid` (identifier of the ZTF object).\n     - `ss_ztf.candid` (candidate identifier).\n     - `ss_ztf.ssdistnr` (distance to the nearest Solar System object).\n     - `ss_ztf.ssmagnr` (MPC archive magnitude of the nearest Solar System object).\n     - `ss_ztf.ssnamenr` (name of the nearest Solar System object).\n   - From the `detection` table:\n     - `detection.fid` (filter identifier).\n     - `detection.fwhm` (FWHM from SExtractor).\n     - `detection.ncalib` (number of PS1 calibrators used).\n     - `detection.exptime` (exposure time).\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: **Order the results (optional)**\n1. If the user does not specify an explicit ordering, the results can be left unordered. However, if needed, you can order the results by a relevant column, such as `probability.probability` in descending order, to prioritize the highest probabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: **Combine all steps into a single query**\n1. Use subqueries and `INNER JOIN` statements to combine the filtered `probability` table with the `ss_ztf` and `detection` tables.\n2. Ensure all conditions and filters are applied correctly, and the final query retrieves only the required columns.\n\n---\n\nBy following these steps, the query will efficiently retrieve the requested information while adhering to the database schema and constraints.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3267, "completion_tokens": 999, "total_tokens": 4266, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 1664, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_f0e307537d"}}, "error": null}

Filter objects with `ndet > 500`.\n\n2. **Subquery for `probability` Table**:\n   - Filter probabilities with the conditions:\n     - `class_name = 'asteroid'`\n     - `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`\n     -

This ensures that only detections associated with the Solar System identifiers are included in the final result.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: **Sort the Results**\n- Sort the final result by the `ssnamenr` column (MPC name) from the `ss_ztf` table and the `mjd` column (detection date) from the `detection` table in ascending order.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: **Output the Results**\n- Ensure the final output includes:\n  - All columns from the `ss_ztf` table.\n  - The selected columns from the `detection` table (`mjd`, `fid`, `isdiffpos`, `ra`, `dec`, `magpsf`, `sigmapsf`).\n\n---\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- Use the Q3C function `q3c_radial_query` for efficient spatial filtering.\n- Ensure that the `ssnamenr` column is properly filtered using the exact names `'2003FP134'` and `'2009UK56'`.\n- The `oid` column is the key for joining the `ss_ztf` and `detection` tables.\n- The angular separation for the spatial query is 2 arcseconds, which must be converted to degrees (0.0005556 degrees).\n- Sorting is performed on `ssnamenr` (MPC name) and `mjd` (detection date) in ascending order.\n\nThis detailed decomposition plan ensures that the query retrieves the requested information accurately and efficiently.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3071, "completion_tokens": 797, "total_tokens": 3868, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_f0e307537d"}}, "error": null}

The query must combine the data from these tables into a single output table, including the specified columns and a column named `table` to indicate the source table for each epoch. Below is the detailed decomposition plan:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Required Columns**\nThe user has requested the following columns in the output:\n1. **ZTF identifier**: This corresponds to the `oid` column in all three tables.\n2. **Epoch date**: This corresponds to the `mjd` column in all three tables.\n3. **Filter identifier**: This corresponds to the `fid` column in all three tables.\n4. **isdiffpos flag**: This corresponds to the `isdiffpos` column in the `detection` and `forced_photometry` tables. For the `non_detection` table, this column does not exist, so it will be set to `NULL`.\n5. **Detection difference magnitude and its uncertainty**: These correspond to the `magpsf` and `sigmapsf` columns in the `detection` table. For the `non_detection` and `forced_photometry` tables, these columns do not exist, so they will be set to `NULL`.\n6. **5-sigma magnitude limit**: This corresponds to the `diffmaglim` column in all three tables.\n7. **Forced difference magnitude and its uncertainty**: These correspond to the `mag` and `e_mag` columns in the `forced_photometry` table. For the `detection` and `non_detection` tables, these columns do not exist, so they will be set to `NULL`.\n8. **Table of origin**: A new column named `table` will be added to indicate the source table for each row. The values will be `'detection'`, `'non_detection'`, or `'forced_photometry'`.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Filter Data for the Specified Object**\n- The user has specified the ZTF object `'ZTF24aamtvxb'`.

The details for each table are as follows:\n\n#### **3.1: Query for the `detection` Table**\n- Select the following columns:\n  - `oid` (as ZTF identifier),\n  - `mjd` (as epoch date),\n  - `fid` (as filter identifier),\n  - `isdiffpos` (as isdiffpos flag),\n  - `magpsf` (as detection difference magnitude),\n  - `sigmapsf` (as detection difference magnitude uncertainty),\n  - `diffmaglim` (as 5-sigma magnitude limit),\n  - `NULL` (for forced difference magnitude, since it does not exist in this table),\n  - `NULL` (for forced difference magnitude uncertainty, since it does not exist in this table),\n  - `'detection'` (as the table of origin).\n- Filter rows where `oid = 'ZTF24aamtvxb'`.\n\n#### **3.2: Query for the `non_detection` Table**\n- Select the following columns:\n  - `oid` (as ZTF identifier),\n  - `mjd` (as epoch date),\n  - `fid` (as filter identifier),\n  - `NULL` (for isdiffpos flag, since it does not exist in this table),\n  - `NULL` (for detection difference magnitude, since it does not exist in this table),\n  - `NULL` (for detection difference magnitude uncertainty, since it does not exist in this table),\n  - `diffmaglim` (as 5-sigma magnitude limit),\n  - `NULL` (for forced difference magnitude, since it does not exist in this table),\n  - `NULL` (for forced difference magnitude uncertainty, since it does not exist in this table),\n  - `'non_detection'` (as the table of origin).\n- Filter rows where `oid = 'ZTF24aamtvxb'`.\n\n#### **3.3: Query for the `forced_photometry` Table**\n- Select the following columns:\n  - `oid` (as ZTF identifier),\n  - `mjd` (as epoch date),\n  - `fid` (as filter identifier),\n  - `isdiffpos` (as isdiffpos flag),\n  - `NULL` (for detection difference magnitude, since it does not exist in this table),\n  - `NULL` (for detection difference magnitude uncertainty, since it does not exist in this table),\n  - `diffmaglim` (as 5-sigma magnitude limit),\n  - `mag` (as forced difference magnitude),\n  - `e_mag` (as forced difference magnitude uncertainty),\n  - `'forced_photometry'` (as the table of origin).\n- Filter rows where `oid = 'ZTF24aamtvxb'`.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Combine the Results**\n- Use a `UNION ALL` statement to combine the results of the three queries from Step 3. This ensures that all rows from the `detection`, `non_detection`, and `forced_photometry` tables are included in the final output.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Order the Results**\n- Add an `ORDER BY` clause to sort the combined results by `mjd` (epoch date) in ascending order. This ensures that the epochs are presented in chronological order.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Final Output**\n- The final output will include the following columns:\n  - `oid` (ZTF identifier),\n  - `mjd` (epoch date),\n  - `fid` (filter identifier),\n  - `isdiffpos` (isdiffpos flag),\n  - `magpsf` (detection difference magnitude),\n  - `sigmapsf` (detection difference magnitude uncertainty),\n  - `diffmaglim` (5-sigma magnitude limit),\n  - `mag` (forced difference magnitude),\n  - `e_mag` (forced difference magnitude uncertainty),\n  - `table` (table of origin).\n\n---\n\nBy following this decomposition plan, you can construct a PostgreSQL query that retrieves the requested information accurately and efficiently.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3732, "completion_tokens": 1393, "total_tokens": 5125, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 3712, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6bdaf6345e"}}, "error": null}

The query involves filtering objects based on conditions from two classifiers (`stamp_classifier` and `lc_classifier_top`), retrieving specific columns, and ordering the results. Below is the detailed decomposition plan:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Filter objects based on the number of detections**\n- Use the `object` table to filter objects with more than 10 detections (`ndet > 10`).\n- Select the `oid` (ZTF identifier), `ndet` (number of detections), and `firstmjd` (first detection date) columns from this table, as these are required in the final output.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Filter probabilities for the stamp classifier**\n- Use the `probability` table to filter objects classified as \"bogus\" in the `stamp_classifier` with the following conditions:\n  - `probability.classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`\n  - `probability.class_name = 'bogus'`\n  - `probability.probability > 0.7`\n  - `probability.classifier_version = 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'`\n  - `probability.ranking = 1` (default condition for the `probability` table).\n- Select the `oid` and the `probability` column (rename this column as `prob_stamp_bogus` for the final output).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Filter probabilities for the light curve classifier top level**\n- Use the `probability` table to filter objects classified as \"Transient\" in the `lc_classifier_top` with the following conditions:\n  - `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier_top'`\n  - `probability.class_name = 'Transient'`\n  - `probability.probability > 0.9`\n  - `probability.ranking = 1` (default condition for the `probability` table).\n- Select the `oid` and the `probability` column (rename this column as `prob_lc_transient` for the final output).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Combine the filters using INNER JOINs**\n- Perform an INNER JOIN between the results of Step 1 (filtered `object` table) and Step 2 (filtered probabilities for the stamp classifier) on the `oid` column. This ensures that only objects satisfying both conditions (more than 10 detections and a probability > 0.7 of being \"bogus\" in the stamp classifier) are included.\n- Perform another INNER JOIN between the result of the above join and the results of Step 3 (filtered probabilities for the light curve classifier top level) on the `oid` column. This ensures that only objects satisfying all three conditions are included.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Select the required columns**\n- From the combined results of Step 4, select the following columns for the final output:\n  - `oid` (ZTF identifier)\n  - `ndet` (number of detections)\n  - `firstmjd` (first detection date)\n  - `prob_stamp_bogus` (probability in the stamp classifier for \"bogus\")\n  - `prob_lc_transient` (probability in the light curve classifier top level for \"Transient\").\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Order the results**\n- Order the results by the `oid` column of objects classified as \"bogus\" in the stamp classifier (ascending order).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Limit the number of results**\n- Limit the final output to at most 30 rows.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of the Query Plan**\n1.

The query involves multiple tables (`object`, `probability`, and `detection`), filtering conditions, and calculations. Below is the detailed decomposition plan:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: **Identify the Required Columns**\nThe user has requested the following columns:\n- `object identifier` (from the `object` table, column `oid`).\n- `candidate identifier` (from the `detection` table, column `candid`).\n- `filter id` as `f_id` (from the `detection` table, column `fid`).\n- `coordinates` (from the `detection` table, columns `ra` and `dec`).\n- `magnitude` (from the `detection` table, column `magpsf`).\n- `magnitude errors` (from the `detection` table, column `sigmapsf`).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: **Filter Objects Based on Classification**\n- Use the `probability` table to filter objects classified as `CV/Nova` by the `stochastic` light curve classifier (`lc_classifier_stochastic`).\n- Apply the default conditions for the `probability` table:\n  - `probability.ranking = 1` (only the most likely probabilities).\n  - `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier_stochastic'`.\n- Ensure the class name is `CV/Nova`.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: **Filter Objects Based on Number of Detections**\n- Use the `object` table to filter objects with a number of detections (`ndet`) of at most 50. This ensures that only objects with limited detections from discovery to the last detection are included.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: **Filter Detections in the r-band**\n- Use the `detection` table to filter detections in the r-band filter (`fid = 2`).\n- Retrieve the corrected difference magnitude (`magpsf_corr`) for these detections.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: **Calculate the Maximum Rise in PSF Corrected Magnitude**\n- For each object, calculate the maximum rise in PSF corrected magnitude (`magpsf_corr`) from the minimum value across all detections in the r-band.\n- This involves:\n  - Grouping detections by `oid`.\n  - Calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum `magpsf_corr` values for each object.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: **Combine the Results**\n- Use an INNER JOIN to combine the filtered objects from the `probability` table (Step 2) with the detections from the `detection` table (Step 4).\n- Ensure that only objects meeting the detection count condition (Step 3) are included.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: **Order and Limit the Results**\n- Order the final results by `object identifier` (`oid`).\n- Limit the output to the first 1000 rows.\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: **Output the Required Columns**\n- Select the following columns in the final output:\n  - `oid` (object identifier).\n  - `candid` (candidate identifier).\n  - `fid` as `f_id` (filter id).\n  - `ra` and `dec` (coordinates).\n  - `magpsf` (magnitude).\n  - `sigmapsf` (magnitude errors).\n  - `magpsf_corr` (corrected difference magnitude in the r-band).\n  - Maximum rise in PSF corrected magnitude (calculated in Step 5).\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Query Construction Steps:\n1. **Subquery for Classification Filtering:**\n   - Create a subquery to filter objects classified as `CV/Nova` by the `lc_classifier_stochastic` classifier with `ranking = 1`.\n\n2. **Subquery for Detection Filtering:**\n   - Create a subquery to filter detections in the r-band (`fid = 2`) and retrieve the required columns (`candid`, `fid`, `ra`, `dec`, `magpsf`, `sigmapsf`, `magpsf_corr`).\n\n3. **Subquery for Detection Count Filtering:**\n   - Create a subquery to filter objects with `ndet <= 50` from the `object` table.\n\n4. **Join Subqueries:**\n   - Use an INNER JOIN to combine the classification subquery (Step 1), detection subquery (Step 2), and detection count subquery (Step 3) based on the `oid` column.\n\n5. **Calculate Maximum Rise in PSF Corrected Magnitude:**\n   - Use a GROUP BY clause to calculate the maximum rise in `magpsf_corr` for each object.\n\n6. **Final Selection and Ordering:**\n   - Select the required columns and order the results by `oid`.\n   - Limit the output to the first 1000 rows.\n\n---\n\nBy following these steps, the query will accurately retrieve the requested information while adhering to the database schema and conditions.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3609, "completion_tokens": 1040, "total_tokens": 4649, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 2944, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_f0e307537d"}}, "error": null}
