Below is the detailed decomposition plan:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Filter objects classified as AGN**\n1. Use the `probability` table to filter objects classified as 'AGN' by the `lc_classifier` classifier.\n   - Add the condition `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'` to ensure we are using the correct classifier.\n   - Add the condition `probability.ranking = 1` to only retrieve the most likely classification for each object.\n   - Add the condition `probability.class_name = 'AGN'` to select objects classified as AGN.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identify objects showing variability in the r band**\n1. Use the `feature` table to identify objects that show variability in the r band.\n   - The feature indicating variability is likely related to statistical measures such as `Std` (standard deviation) or `ExcessVar` (intrinsic variability amplitude).\n   - Filter for the r band by setting `feature.fid = 2` (r band).\n   - Add a condition to check that the variability feature (e.g., `Std` or `ExcessVar`) has a value greater than 0, indicating variability.\n\n2.

Use the `feature` table to identify objects with no detections or no variability in the g band.\n   - For no detections:\n     - Use the feature `n_det` (number of detections) and filter for `feature.fid = 1` (g band).\n     - Add a condition to check that `n_det = 0`, indicating no detections in the g band.\n   - For no variability:\n     - Use the same variability feature as in Step 2 (e.g., `Std` or `ExcessVar`) and filter for `feature.fid = 1` (g band).\n     - Add a condition to check that the variability feature has a value equal to 0, indicating no variability in the g band.\n\n2. Create a sub-query to retrieve the `oid` of objects that meet either of the above conditions (no detections or no variability in the g band).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Combine the results from Steps 2 and 3**\n1. Use an `INTERSECT` operation to combine the results from Step 1 (objects classified as AGN) and Step 2 (objects showing variability in the r band).\n   - This ensures that only objects classified as AGN and showing variability in the r band are selected.\n\n2. Use another `INTERSECT` operation to combine the result from Step 4.1 with the result from Step 3 (objects with no detections or no variability in the g band).\n   - This ensures that the final result includes only objects classified as AGN, showing variability in the r band, and having no detections or no variability in the g band.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Retrieve features and order by their value**\n1. Use the `feature` table to retrieve all features for the objects identified in Step 4.\n   - Use an `INNER JOIN` between the `feature` table and the result from Step 4 to retrieve features for the selected objects.\n   - Order the features by their `value` column in ascending order.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Order the final result by `oid`**\n1.

Use the `probability` table to filter objects classified as 'AGN' by the `lc_classifier`.\n   - Add the condition `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'` to ensure we are using the light curve classifier.\n   - Add the condition `probability.ranking = 1` to only consider the most likely classification.\n   - Add the condition `probability.class_name = 'AGN'` to select objects classified as AGN.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identify objects showing variability in the r band**\n1. Use the `feature` table to identify objects that show variability in the r band.\n   - Variability can be determined using features such as `ExcessVar` or other variability-related features.

The query involves multiple conditions, joins, and nested subqueries. Below is the detailed decomposition plan:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Filter objects classified as AGN with a probability larger than 0.6**\n1. Use the `probability` table to filter objects classified as 'AGN' by the `lc_classifier` classifier.\n   - Add the condition `probability.class_name = 'AGN'`.\n   - Add the condition `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`.\n   - Add the condition `probability.ranking = 1` (default condition for the most likely classification).\n   - Add the condition `probability.probability > 0.6` to ensure the classification probability is greater than 0.6.\n2. Retrieve the `oid` of these objects for further filtering.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Filter objects with light curves covering at least one year**\n1. Use the `object` table to filter objects where the light curve spans at least one year.\n   - Calculate the time span using the difference between `object.lastmjd` and `object.firstmjd`.\n   - Add the condition `(object.lastmjd - object.firstmjd) >= 365` to ensure the light curve covers at least one year.\n2. Join this condition with the `oid` values obtained from Step 1.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Filter objects with at least 20 detections in at least one band**\n1. Use the `feature` table to filter objects with at least 20 detections in one band.\n   - Add the condition `feature.name = 'n_det'` to select the feature representing the number of detections.\n   - Add the condition `feature.value >= 20` to ensure at least 20 detections.\n   - Use the `oid` values from Step 2 to filter the `feature` table.\n2. Retrieve the `oid` values of objects meeting this condition.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Filter objects with variations larger than 1 magnitude in the g band and larger than 0.5 in the r band**\n1. Use the `feature` table to filter objects based on magnitude variations in the g and r bands.\n   - For the g band:\n     - Add the condition `feature.name = 'delta_mag_fid'` to select the feature representing magnitude variation.\n     - Add the condition `feature.fid = 1` (g band).\n     - Add the condition `feature.value > 1` to ensure the variation is larger than 1 magnitude.\n   - For the r band:\n     - Add the condition `feature.name = 'delta_mag_fid'`.\n     - Add the condition `feature.fid = 2` (r band).\n     - Add the condition `feature.value > 0.5` to ensure the variation is larger than 0.5 magnitude.\n2.

Join the resulting `oid` values with the `oid` values from Step 3.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Retrieve the required columns**\n1. Use the `object` table to retrieve the following columns:\n   - `oid`\n   - `meanra` (mean right ascension)\n   - `meandec` (mean declination)\n   - `ndet` (number of detections)\n2.

Use the `detection` table to calculate the maximum and minimum corrected magnitudes for the g and r bands:\n   - For the g band:\n     - Add the condition `detection.fid = 1` (g band).\n     - Use the `MAX(detection.magpsf_corr)` and `MIN(detection.magpsf_corr)` functions to calculate the maximum and minimum corrected magnitudes.\n   - For the r band:\n     - Add the condition `detection.fid = 2` (r band).\n     - Use the `MAX(detection.magpsf_corr)` and `MIN(detection.magpsf_corr)` functions to calculate the maximum and minimum corrected magnitudes.\n4. Calculate the magnitude variations (delta_mag) for the g and r bands:\n   - For the g band: `delta_mag_g = MAX(detection.magpsf_corr) - MIN(detection.magpsf_corr)`.\n   - For the r band: `delta_mag_r = MAX(detection.magpsf_corr) - MIN(detection.magpsf_corr)`.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Combine all conditions and retrieve the final result**\n1. Use the `oid` values obtained from Step 4 to filter the `object`, `feature`, and `detection` tables.\n2. Perform the necessary joins:\n   - Join the `object` table with the `feature` table on `oid`.\n   - Join the `object` table with the `detection` table on `oid`.\n3. Apply all the conditions from Steps 1 to 4 to filter the data.\n4. Retrieve the required columns:\n   - From the `object` table: `oid`, `meanra`, `meandec`, `ndet`.\n   - From the `feature` table: `name`, `value`, `version`, `fid` (aliased as `feature_fid`).\n   - From the `detection` table: maximum and minimum corrected magnitudes for the g and r bands, and the magnitude variations (delta_mag_g and delta_mag_r).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Format the output**\n1. Alias the calculated magnitude variations as `delta_mag_g` and `delta_mag_r`.\n2. Alias the `fid` column from the `feature` table as `feature_fid`.\n\n---\n\nBy following these steps, the query will retrieve all objects classified as AGN with the specified conditions, along with the required columns and calculated values.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 6073, "completion_tokens": 1332, "total_tokens": 7405, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_f0e307537d"}}, "error": null}

Use the `detection` table to retrieve the following columns for the selected objects:\n   - `min_mag` (minimum corrected magnitude).\n   - `max_mag` (maximum corrected magnitude).\n\n5. Use `INNER JOIN` or sub-queries to combine the data from the `object`, `feature`, and `detection` tables based on the `oid`.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Format the output**\n1. Alias the `fid` columns from the `feature` table as `feature_fid`.\n2. Alias the calculated variations in the g and r bands as `delta_mag_g` and `delta_mag_r`, respectively.\n3. Ensure the final output includes the following columns:\n   - `oid`\n   - `name` (feature name)\n   - `value` (feature value)\n   - `version` (feature version)\n   - `feature_fid` (filter id from the `feature` table)\n   - `meanra` (mean right ascension)\n   - `meandec` (mean declination)\n   - `ndet` (number of detections)\n   - `min_mag` (minimum corrected magnitude)\n   - `max_mag` (maximum corrected magnitude)\n   - `delta_mag_g` (variation in the g band)\n   - `delta_mag_r` (variation in the r band).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Optimize the query**\n1.

The query involves multiple tables (`object`, `probability`, `detection`, `non_detection`, and `magstat`) and requires filtering, joining, and nested queries. Below is the detailed decomposition plan:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Filter objects based on the `stamp_classifier` with the highest probability for class 'SN'**\n1. Use the `probability` table to filter objects where:\n   - `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'` (to focus on the stamp classifier).\n   - `class_name = 'SN'` (to select objects classified as 'SN').\n   - `ranking = 1` (to ensure we only consider the highest probability for each object).\n2. Retrieve the `oid` and the associated `probability` for these objects.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Filter objects with their first detection in the first two days of September**\n1. Use the `object` table to filter objects where:\n   - `firstmjd >= 60188.0` (September 1st).\n   - `firstmjd < 60190.0` (September 3rd, exclusive).\n2. Retrieve the `oid` of these objects.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Identify objects that qualify as fast risers**\n1. Use the `detection` table to retrieve the first detection for each object:\n   - Group by `oid` and `fid` (filter ID).\n   - Select the detection with the minimum `mjd` (first detection time) for each `oid` and `fid`.\n   - Retrieve the `oid`, `fid`, `mjd` (first detection time), and `magpsf` (magnitude at first detection).\n2. Use the `non_detection` table to retrieve the last non-detection before the first detection for each object:\n   - For each `oid` and `fid`, filter `non_detection.mjd` such that it is less than the first detection `mjd` (from Step 3.1).\n   - Select the non-detection with the maximum `mjd` (last non-detection time) for each `oid` and `fid`.\n   - Retrieve the `oid`, `fid`, `mjd` (last non-detection time), and `diffmaglim` (limiting magnitude at last non-detection).\n3. Combine the results from Steps 3.1 and 3.2 to calculate the magnitude rise rate:\n   - Join the first detection and last non-detection results on `oid` and `fid`.\n   - Calculate the rise rate as `(diffmaglim - magpsf) / (first_detection_mjd - last_non_detection_mjd)`.\n   - Filter objects where the rise rate is greater than or equal to 0.25 magnitudes/day.\n   - Retrieve the `oid`, `fid`, `first_detection_mjd`, `last_non_detection_mjd`, `magpsf`, and `diffmaglim`.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Combine results from Steps 1, 2, and 3**\n1. Perform an INNER JOIN between the results of Step 1 (objects classified as 'SN') and Step 2 (objects with first detection in early September) on `oid`.\n2.

Use the `detection` table to retrieve light curve data for the filtered objects:\n   - Filter detections where `oid` is in the results from Step 4.\n   - Retrieve `oid`, `mjd`, `fid`, `magpsf`, and `sigmapsf`.\n2. Use the `non_detection` table to retrieve non-detection data for the filtered objects:\n   - Filter non-detections where `oid` is in the results from Step 4.\n   - Retrieve `oid`, `mjd`, `fid`, and `diffmaglim`.\n3. Combine the results from Steps 5.1 and 5.2 using a UNION to create a complete light curve dataset (detections and non-detections).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Retrieve additional information from the `magstat` table**\n1. Use the `magstat` table to retrieve additional statistics for the filtered objects:\n   - Filter rows where `oid` is in the results from Step 4.\n   - Retrieve `oid`, `fid` (as `magstat_fid`), and other relevant columns (e.g., `magmean`, `magmedian`, etc., if needed).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Combine all results and finalize the query**\n1. Combine the results from Steps 4, 5, and 6 using appropriate JOINs on `oid` and `fid`.\n2. Order the final results by `oid`.\n3. Limit the results to 100 rows to meet the time constraint.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of the Final Output**\nThe final query will return:\n- `oid` (object identifier).\n- `probability` (highest probability in the stamp classifier for class 'SN').\n- Light curve data (detections and non-detections) including:\n  - `mjd` (time of observation).\n  - `fid` (filter ID).\n  - `magpsf` and `sigmapsf` (for detections).\n  - `diffmaglim` (for non-detections).\n- Additional statistics from the `magstat` table:\n  - `fid` (as `magstat_fid`).\n  - Other relevant columns (e.g., `magmean`, `magmedian`, etc.).\n- Initial rise estimate:\n  - `first_detection_mjd`, `last_non_detection_mjd`, `magpsf`, and `diffmaglim`.\n- Results ordered by `oid` and limited to 100 rows.\n\nThis decomposition ensures that the query is accurate, efficient, and adheres to the database schema and user requirements.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4511, "completion_tokens": 1343, "total_tokens": 5854, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 4480, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_f0e307537d"}}, "error": null}

The query must return the following columns:\n   - `oid` (object identifier),\n   - `meanra` (mean right ascension),\n   - `meandec` (mean declination),\n   - `ndet` (number of detections),\n   - `firstmjd` (time of first detection),\n   - `class_name` (classification name),\n   - `probability` (classification probability).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**\n1. **`object` Table**:\n   - Contains information about the objects, including `oid`, `meanra`, `meandec`, `ndet`, and `firstmjd`.\n   - Use this table to filter objects based on `ndet` and `firstmjd`.\n2. **`probability` Table**:\n   - Contains classification probabilities and rankings for objects.\n   - Use this table to filter objects classified as 'asteroid' by the `stamp_classifier` with a probability greater than 0.7.\n   - Default conditions for this table:\n     - `ranking = 1` (most likely classification).\n     - `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'` (use the stamp classifier).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: **Apply Filtering Conditions**\n1. **Filter by Date Range**:\n   - Use the `firstmjd` column from the `object` table to select objects with `firstmjd` between 59274.0 and 59305.0.\n2. **Filter by Number of Detections**:\n   - Use the `ndet` column from the `object` table to select objects with `ndet <= 1`.\n3. **Filter by Classification**:\n   - Use the `probability` table to select objects classified as 'asteroid' by the `stamp_classifier` with:\n     - `probability > 0.7`.\n     - `ranking = 1` (default condition).\n     - `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'` (default condition).\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: **Join Tables**\n1. Perform an `INNER JOIN` between the `object` table and the `probability` table:\n   - Join on the `oid` column, which is the unique object identifier present in both tables.\n   - This ensures that only objects with classification information are included in the results.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: **Select Required Columns**\n1. From the `object` table:\n   - `oid`, `meanra`, `meandec`, `ndet`, `firstmjd`.\n2. From the `probability` table:\n   - `class_name`, `probability`.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: **Order the Results (Optional)**\n- If the user does not specify an order, no explicit sorting is required. However, you may choose to sort the results by `firstmjd` in ascending order for better readability.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: **Test and Validate the Query**\n1. Ensure that the query adheres to the default conditions for the `probability` table.\n2. Verify that the filtering conditions (date range, number of detections, classification) are correctly applied.\n3. Confirm that the selected columns match the user's requirements.\n\n---\n\n### Final Decomposition Plan Summary\n1. Start by selecting data from the `object` table.\n   - Filter objects with `firstmjd` between 59274.0 and 59305.0.\n   - Filter objects with `ndet <= 1`.\n2. Perform an `INNER JOIN` with the `probability` table on the `oid` column.\n   - Filter rows where:\n     - `class_name = 'asteroid'`.\n     - `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`.\n     - `ranking = 1`.\n     - `probability > 0.7`.\n3. Select the required columns: `oid`, `meanra`, `meandec`, `ndet`, `firstmjd`, `class_name`, and `probability`.\n4. (Optional) Sort the results by `firstmjd` in ascending order.\n\nThis plan ensures that the query is accurate, efficient, and adheres to the user's requirements.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3392, "completion_tokens": 1001, "total_tokens": 4393, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 3200, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_f0e307537d"}}, "error": null}

Filter the `detection` table for the given list of `oids`.\n2. Apply the condition `drb > 0.5` on the `detection` table.\n3. Filter the `ps1_ztf` table for the same list of `oids`.\n4. Apply the conditions `sgscore1 < 0.5` OR `distpsnr1 < 1` on the `ps1_ztf` table.\n5. Perform an `INNER JOIN` between the `detection` and `ps1_ztf` tables on the `oid` column.\n6. Select the required columns from both tables.\n7. Optionally, sort the results if needed.\n8. Test and validate the query.\n\nThis plan ensures the query is accurate, efficient, and retrieves the requested information.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3504, "completion_tokens": 927, "total_tokens": 4431, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 3456, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_f0e307537d"}}, "error": null}

The query involves spatial filtering using the Q3C extension, combining results from two different spatial searches, and returning specific columns for both the input objects and the output ZTF objects. Below is the detailed decomposition plan:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Define the Input Objects and Their Search Parameters**\n1. Create a temporary inline table using the `WITH` clause to define the input objects and their associated coordinates and search radii. This table will include:\n   - `source_id`: Identifier for the input objects (`id_1` and `id_2`).\n   - `ra`: Right Ascension (RA) of the input objects.\n   - `dec`: Declination (Dec) of the input objects.\n   - `radius`: Search radius in degrees for each input object (30 arcsec = 0.008333 degrees for `id_1`, and 20 arcsec = 0.005556 degrees for `id_2`).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Perform Spatial Filtering for Each Input Object**\n1. Use the `q3c_radial_query` function to filter ZTF objects from the `object` table that lie within the specified search radius of each input object.\n   - For `id_1`, filter objects within 0.008333 degrees of (RA, Dec) = (354.67, 15.954).\n   - For `id_2`, filter objects within 0.005556 degrees of (RA, Dec) = (20.7993, 1.00331).\n2. Create two subqueries for these spatial searches:\n   - Subquery 1: Retrieve ZTF objects for `id_1` using `q3c_radial_query`.\n   - Subquery 2: Retrieve ZTF objects for `id_2` using `q3c_radial_query`.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Combine Results from Both Spatial Searches**\n1. Use a `UNION` operation to combine the results of the two spatial searches. This ensures that all ZTF objects meeting either of the spatial criteria are included in the final result.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Select and Format the Output Columns**\n1. For the input objects (`id_1` and `id_2`), include the following columns:\n   - `source_id`: Identifier of the input object.\n   - `ra`: Right Ascension of the input object.\n   - `dec`: Declination of the input object.\n   - `radius`: Search radius used for the input object.\n2. For the output ZTF objects, include the following columns from the `object` table:\n   - `oid`: ZTF identifier.\n   - `ndet`: Number of detections.\n   - `meanra`: Mean RA coordinate.\n   - `meandec`: Mean Dec coordinate.\n   - `firstmjd`: First detection date.\n3. Use a `SELECT` statement to retrieve these columns from the combined results of the spatial searches.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Sort the Results**\n1. Sort the output ZTF objects by the `lastmjd` column (last detection date) in descending order. This ensures that the most recently detected objects appear first in the result.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Finalize the Query**\n1. Combine all the steps into a single query:\n   - Use the `WITH` clause to define the input objects and their search parameters.\n   - Perform spatial filtering for each input object using `q3c_radial_query`.\n   - Combine the results of the spatial searches using `UNION`.\n   - Select and format the required columns for both input and output objects.\n   - Sort the results by `lastmjd` in descending order.\n\n---\n\n### **Additional Notes**\n- Ensure that the `q3c_radial_query` function is used correctly with the appropriate order of parameters: `(ra, dec, center_ra, center_dec, radius)`.\n- Use the exact column names from the `object` table (`oid`, `ndet`, `meanra`, `meandec`, `firstmjd`, `lastmjd`).\n- Include the input object details (`source_id`, `ra`, `dec`, `radius`) in the final result for clarity.\n- Test the query to verify that it returns the expected results and performs efficiently.\n\nThis detailed decomposition plan ensures that the query is accurate, efficient, and meets the user's requirements.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2900, "completion_tokens": 932, "total_tokens": 3832, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 2176, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_f0e307537d"}}, "error": null}

Create two subqueries, one for each input object, to retrieve the ZTF objects that satisfy the spatial filtering conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Combine Results from Both Spatial Searches**\n1. Use a `UNION` operation to combine the results of the two spatial searches. This ensures that all ZTF objects that satisfy either of the spatial conditions are included in the final result.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Select and Format the Output Columns**\n1. For the input objects, include the following columns:\n   - `identifier`: The name of the input object (e.g., 'id_1', 'id_2').\n   - `ra`: The right ascension of the input object.\n   - `dec`: The declination of the input object.\n   - `search_radius`: The search radius used for the input object in degrees.\n2. For the output ZTF objects, include the following columns from the `object` table:\n   - `oid`: The ZTF object identifier.\n   - `ndet`: The number of detections for the ZTF object.\n   - `meanra`: The mean right ascension of the ZTF object.\n   - `meandec`: The mean declination of the ZTF object.\n   - `firstmjd`: The first detection date of the ZTF object.\n3. Use a `SELECT` statement to combine the input object information with the output ZTF object information.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Sort the Results**\n1. Sort the combined results by the `lastmjd` column (last detection date) in descending order. This ensures that the most recently detected objects appear first in the output.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Finalize the Query**\n1. Ensure that the query includes all necessary conditions and joins, and that the output format matches the user\u2019s request.\n2. Verify that the query uses the Q3C functions correctly for spatial filtering and that the column names match the database schema.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of the Query Logic**\n1. Define the input objects and their search parameters using a `WITH` clause.\n2. Perform spatial filtering for each input object using `q3c_radial_query`.\n3. Combine the results of the spatial searches using a `UNION` operation.\n4. Select the required columns for both the input objects and the output ZTF objects.\n5. Sort the results by the last detection date in descending order.\n\nThis decomposition plan ensures that the query retrieves the requested information accurately and efficiently, adhering to the database schema and user requirements.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2900, "completion_tokens": 873, "total_tokens": 3773, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_f0e307537d"}}, "error": null}

The query involves spatial filtering using the Q3C extension, combining results from two different spatial searches, and retrieving specific columns for both the input objects and the output ZTF objects. Below is the detailed decomposition plan:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Define the input objects and their search parameters**\n1. Create a temporary inline table using the `WITH` clause to define the input objects and their associated parameters:\n   - Object `id_1` with coordinates `(RA, Dec) = (354.67, 15.954)` and a search radius of `30 arcsec` (convert to degrees: `30 / 3600 = 0.008333` degrees).\n   - Object `id_2` with coordinates `(RA, Dec) = (20.7993, 1.00331)` and a search radius of `20 arcsec` (convert to degrees: `20 / 3600 = 0.005556` degrees).\n2. The inline table should include the following columns: `identifier`, `ra`, `dec`, and `search_radius`.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Perform spatial filtering for each input object**\n1. Use the `q3c_radial_query` function to filter ZTF objects from the `object` table that lie within the specified search radius of each input object.\n   - For `id_1`, filter objects within `0.008333` degrees of `(354.67, 15.954)`.\n   - For `id_2`, filter objects within `0.005556` degrees of `(20.7993, 1.00331)`.\n2. Create two subqueries, one for each input object, to retrieve the ZTF objects that satisfy the spatial filtering conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Combine the results of the two spatial searches**\n1. Use a `UNION` operation to combine the results of the two subqueries from Step 2. This ensures that all ZTF objects that satisfy either of the spatial conditions are included in the final result.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Retrieve the required columns for the output ZTF objects**\n1. From the `object` table, retrieve the following columns for the ZTF objects:\n   - `oid` (ZTF identifier),\n   - `ndet` (number of detections),\n   - `meanra` (mean RA coordinate),\n   - `meandec` (mean Dec coordinate),\n   - `firstmjd` (first detection date),\n   - `lastmjd` (last detection date).\n2. Include the `identifier`, `ra`, `dec`, and `search_radius` columns from the input objects for reference.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Sort the results**\n1. Sort the combined results by the `lastmjd` column (last detection date) in descending order.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Finalize the query structure**\n1. Use the `WITH` clause to define the inline table for the input objects.\n2. Create two subqueries for the spatial filtering using `q3c_radial_query`.\n3. Combine the results of the two subqueries using `UNION`.\n4. Retrieve the required columns for both the input objects and the output ZTF objects.\n5. Apply the sorting condition to the final result.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Verify the query**\n1. Ensure that the `q3c_radial_query` function is used correctly with the appropriate order of parameters: `(ra, dec, center_ra, center_dec, radius)`.\n2. Confirm that the `UNION` operation does not introduce duplicate rows (if duplicates are possible, use `UNION ALL` instead of `UNION`).\n3. Validate that the sorting condition (`ORDER BY lastmjd DESC`) is applied correctly.\n\n---\n\nBy following these steps, the query will retrieve all ZTF objects that meet the spatial filtering criteria, along with the required columns for both the input objects and the output ZTF objects, sorted by the last detection date in descending order.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2900, "completion_tokens": 855, "total_tokens": 3755, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 2816, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_f0e307537d"}}, "error": null}

It will be used to filter objects classified as supernovae ('SN') by the **`stamp_classifier`** with a probability greater than 0.7.\n     - **`dataquality`**: This table contains detailed data quality information for objects. The query will return all columns from this table for the filtered objects.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Set the Default Conditions for the `probability` Table**\n   - Use the following default conditions for the `probability` table:\n     - `probability.ranking = 1`: This ensures that only the most likely classification for each object is considered.\n     - `probability.classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`: This ensures that the classification is based on the stamp classifier.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Apply the User-Specified Conditions**\n   - Add the user-specified conditions:\n     - `probability.class_name = 'SN'`: This filters objects classified as supernovae.\n     - `probability.probability > 0.7`: This ensures that only objects with a classification probability greater than 0.7 are included.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Join the Tables**\n   - Use an **INNER JOIN** between the `probability` table and the `dataquality` table:\n     - The join condition is `probability.oid = dataquality.oid`, as the `oid` column is the unique object identifier present in both tables.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Limit the Number of Results**\n   - Use the `LIMIT` clause to restrict the number of results to at most 50 objects, as specified by the user.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Select the Required Columns**\n   - Select all columns from the `dataquality` table, as requested by the user.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Order the Results (Optional)**\n   - If no specific ordering is requested, the results can be returned in the default order. However, if needed, you can order the results by `probability.probability` in descending order to prioritize objects with the highest classification probability.\n\n---\n\n### Final Decomposition Plan:\n1.

The query involves filtering objects based on conditions from multiple tables (`object`, `probability`, and `ps1_ztf`), applying specific constraints, and ordering the results. Below is the detailed decomposition plan:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Filter objects based on the distance to the nearest PS1 source**\n1. Identify the relevant column in the `ps1_ztf` table that contains the distance to the nearest PS1 source. This column is `distpsnr1`.\n2. Apply the condition that the distance to the nearest PS1 source (`distpsnr1`) must be greater than 5 arcseconds.\n3. Create a subquery or filter to retrieve only the `oid` values from the `ps1_ztf` table that satisfy this condition.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Filter objects based on classification probability**\n1. Use the `probability` table to filter objects based on their classification probabilities.\n2. Apply the following conditions:\n   - The `probability.ranking` must be equal to 1 (default condition for the `probability` table).\n   - The `probability.classifier_name` must be `'lc_classifier'` (default condition for the `probability` table).\n   - The `probability.probability` must be greater than 0.7.\n   - The `probability.class_name` must **not** be one of the supernova classes (`'SNIa'`, `'SNIbc'`, `'SNII'`, `'SLSN'`).\n3. Create a subquery to retrieve the `oid` values from the `probability` table that satisfy these conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Combine the filters from Step 1 and Step 2**\n1. Perform an `INNER JOIN` between the results of Step 1 (filtered `oid` values from `ps1_ztf`) and Step 2 (filtered `oid` values from `probability`) to find objects that satisfy both conditions.\n2. Use the `oid` column as the common key for the join.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Retrieve all columns from the `object`, `probability`, and `ps1_ztf` tables**\n1. Use the `oid` values obtained from Step 3 to retrieve all columns from the `object`, `probability`, and `ps1_ztf` tables.\n2. Perform `INNER JOIN` operations between the `object`, `probability`, and `ps1_ztf` tables using the `oid` column as the common key.\n3. Ensure that the `probability` table is filtered with the default conditions (`ranking = 1` and `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`) during the join.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Order the results by the nearest PS1 source distance**\n1. Use the `distpsnr1` column from the `ps1_ztf` table to order the results in ascending order (smallest distance first).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Limit the number of results to 200**\n1. Apply a `LIMIT` clause to restrict the output to at most 200 rows.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Final Query Structure**\n1. The final query will:\n   - Combine the filters from Step 1 and Step 2 using an `INNER JOIN`.\n   - Retrieve all columns from the `object`, `probability`, and `ps1_ztf` tables.\n   - Order the results by `distpsnr1` in ascending order.\n   - Limit the output to 200 rows.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Steps**\n1. Filter `ps1_ztf` table for objects with `distpsnr1 > 5`.\n2. Filter `probability` table for objects with:\n   - `ranking = 1`\n   - `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`\n   - `probability > 0.7`\n   - `class_name NOT IN ('SNIa', 'SNIbc', 'SNII', 'SLSN')`.\n3.

The query involves filtering objects based on conditions from multiple tables (`object`, `probability`, and `ps1_ztf`), applying specific constraints, and ordering the results. Below is the detailed decomposition plan:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Filter objects based on the distance to the nearest PS1 source**\n1. Identify the relevant column in the `ps1_ztf` table that represents the distance to the nearest PS1 source. This column is `distpsnr1`.\n2. Apply the condition `distpsnr1 > 5` (distance to the nearest PS1 source must be larger than 5 arcsec).\n3. Use the `oid` column from the `ps1_ztf` table to link this condition to the `object` table.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Filter objects based on classification probability**\n1. Use the `probability` table to filter objects based on their classification probabilities.\n2. Apply the following conditions:\n   - `probability.ranking = 1` (only consider the most likely class for each object).\n   - `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'` (use the light curve classifier).\n   - `probability.probability > 0.7` (probability of the class must be greater than 0.7).\n   - Exclude objects classified as supernova. This means filtering out rows where `probability.class_name` is one of the supernova-related classes: `'SNIa'`, `'SNIbc'`, `'SNII'`, or `'SLSN'`.\n3. Use the `oid` column from the `probability` table to link this condition to the `object` table.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Combine the filters from Step 1 and Step 2**\n1. Perform an `INNER JOIN` between the `ps1_ztf` table and the `probability` table using the `oid` column to combine the conditions from Step 1 and Step 2.\n2. Ensure that only objects satisfying both conditions (distance and probability) are included in the result.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Retrieve all columns from the `object`, `probability`, and `ps1_ztf` tables**\n1. Use the `oid` column to join the `object` table with the combined result from Step 3.\n2. Select all columns from the `object`, `probability`, and `ps1_ztf` tables.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Limit the number of results**\n1. Use the `LIMIT` clause to restrict the number of results to at most 200 objects.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Order the results by the nearest PS1 source distance**\n1. Use the `distpsnr1` column from the `ps1_ztf` table to order the results in ascending order (smallest distance first).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Final Query Structure**\n1. The query will involve multiple `INNER JOIN` operations to combine the `object`, `probability`, and `ps1_ztf` tables.\n2. The filtering conditions will be applied in the `WHERE` clause.\n3. The results will be ordered using the `ORDER BY` clause.\n4. The `LIMIT` clause will ensure that at most 200 objects are returned.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Steps**\n1.

Identify the `ps1_ztf` table as the source of information about the distance to the nearest PS1 source. The relevant column is `distpsnr1`, which represents the distance to the closest source.\n2.

Perform an `INNER JOIN` between the `ps1_ztf` and `probability` tables using the `oid` column, which is the unique object identifier.

Use the `ORDER BY` clause to sort the results in ascending order of `distpsnr1` (the distance to the nearest PS1 source).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Final Query Structure**\n1. Combine all the above steps into a single query structure:\n   - Start with a subquery to filter objects based on the `distpsnr1 > 5` condition from the `ps1_ztf` table.\n   - Use another subquery to filter objects based on the probability conditions from the `probability` table.\n   - Perform `INNER JOIN` operations to combine the filtered results with the `object` table.\n   - Retrieve all columns from the `object`, `probability`, and `ps1_ztf` tables.\n   - Apply the `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY` clauses to finalize the query.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Steps**\n1.

Objects must have at least 10 detections in the g band (`fid = 1`).\n  2. Objects must not have dubious corrections (`dubious = FALSE`) in the g band.\n  3. The query should return at most 500 results, ordered by their `oid`.\n  4. The output should include the following columns:\n     - ZTF identifier (`oid` from the `object` table),\n     - Classifier version (`classifier_version` from the `probability` table),\n     - Class name (`class_name` from the `probability` table),\n     - Probability (`probability` from the `probability` table).\n  5. Only include probabilities with:\n     - `ranking = 1` (most likely class),\n     - `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'` (light curve classifier).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**\n- **`object` table**: Contains the main statistics of ZTF objects, including the `oid` (ZTF identifier).\n- **`detection` table**: Contains information about detections, including:\n  - `oid` (ZTF identifier),\n  - `fid` (filter identifier, where `1` corresponds to the g band),\n  - `dubious` (whether the detection is dubious or not).\n- **`probability` table**: Contains classification probabilities and rankings, including:\n  - `oid` (ZTF identifier),\n  - `class_name` (name of the class),\n  - `classifier_name` (name of the classifier),\n  - `classifier_version` (version of the classifier),\n  - `probability` (classification probability),\n  - `ranking` (ranking of the probability).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: **Apply Filtering Conditions**\n1. **Filter for detections in the g band**:\n   - Use `fid = 1` to select detections in the g band.\n2. **Filter for non-dubious detections**:\n   - Use `dubious = FALSE` to exclude dubious detections.\n3. **Count detections per object**:\n   - Group detections by `oid` and count the number of detections for each object.\n   - Only include objects with at least 10 detections (`COUNT(oid) >= 10`).\n4. **Filter for classification probabilities**:\n   - Use `ranking = 1` to include only the most likely class.\n   - Use `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'` to include only classifications from the light curve classifier.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: **Join Tables**\n- Use an `INNER JOIN` between the `detection` table and the `object` table to filter objects based on the detection conditions.\n- Use another `INNER JOIN` between the filtered results and the `probability` table to include classification probabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: **Select and Order Columns**\n- Select the required columns:\n  - `oid` (ZTF identifier),\n  - `classifier_version`,\n  - `class_name`,\n  - `probability`.\n- Order the results by `oid` in ascending order.\n- Limit the results to 500 rows.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: **Set Default Conditions**\n- Ensure the following default conditions are applied:\n  - `ranking = 1` in the `probability` table.\n  - `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'` in the `probability` table.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: **Limit the Number of Results**\n- Use the `LIMIT` clause to restrict the output to at most 500 rows.\n\n---\n\n### Final Decomposition Plan:\n1. Start by filtering the `detection` table for:\n   - `fid = 1` (g band),\n   - `dubious = FALSE` (non-dubious detections).\n2. Group the filtered detections by `oid` and count the number of detections for each object.\n   - Include only objects with at least 10 detections (`COUNT(oid) >= 10`).\n3. Join the filtered results with the `object` table to retrieve object-level information.\n4. Join the results with the `probability` table to include classification probabilities.\n   - Apply the conditions:\n     - `ranking = 1`,\n     - `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`.\n5. Select the required columns:\n   - `oid` (ZTF identifier),\n   - `classifier_version`,\n   - `class_name`,\n   - `probability`.\n6. Order the results by `oid` in ascending order.\n7.

This will serve as the base for further filtering and joining.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Join with the `ss_ztf` table**\n1. **Purpose**: Retrieve information about the nearest Solar System object for the filtered `oid` values from Step 1.\n2. **Join Type**: Perform an `INNER JOIN` between the `probability` table (filtered in Step 1) and the `ss_ztf` table using the `oid` column.\n3. **Columns to Select**:\n   - `ss_ztf.oid` (identifier of the ZTF object).\n   - `ss_ztf.candid` (unique candidate identifier).\n   - `ss_ztf.ssdistnr` (distance to the nearest Solar System object).\n   - `ss_ztf.ssmagnr` (MPC archive magnitude of the nearest Solar System object).\n   - `ss_ztf.ssnamenr` (name of the nearest Solar System object).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Join with the `detection` table**\n1. **Purpose**: Retrieve additional candidate-related information for the filtered `oid` and `candid` values from Step 2.\n2. **Join Type**: Perform an `INNER JOIN` between the result of Step 2 and the `detection` table using the `oid` and `candid` columns.\n3. **Columns to Select**:\n   - `detection.fid` (filter identifier).\n   - `detection.fwhm` (FWHM from SExtractor).\n   - `detection.ncalib` (number of PS1 calibrators used).\n   - `detection.exptime` (exposure time).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Limit the Results**\n1. **Purpose**: Restrict the output to at most 30 rows, as requested by the user.\n2. **Condition**: Use a `LIMIT` clause to ensure the result set contains no more than 30 rows.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Combine and Format the Output**\n1. **Purpose**: Combine the selected columns from Steps 2 and 3 into a single output table.\n2. **Columns to Include**:\n   - From `ss_ztf`:\n     - `oid` (identifier of the ZTF object).\n     - `candid` (unique candidate identifier).\n     - `ssdistnr` (distance to the nearest Solar System object).\n     - `ssmagnr` (MPC archive magnitude of the nearest Solar System object).\n     - `ssnamenr` (name of the nearest Solar System object).\n   - From `detection`:\n     - `fid` (filter identifier).\n     - `fwhm` (FWHM from SExtractor).\n     - `ncalib` (number of PS1 calibrators used).\n     - `exptime` (exposure time).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Final Query Structure**\n1. **Subquery 1**: Filter the `probability` table to get `oid` values for objects classified as asteroids with a probability > 0.9 (Step 1).\n2. **Subquery 2**: Join the filtered `oid` values with the `ss_ztf` table to retrieve Solar System object information (Step 2).\n3. **Subquery 3**: Join the result of Subquery 2 with the `detection` table to retrieve candidate-related information (Step 3).\n4. **Final Query**: Combine the results of Subquery 3 and apply the `LIMIT` clause to restrict the output to 30 rows (Steps 4 and 5).\n\n---\n\n### **Additional Notes**\n- Ensure that all joins are `INNER JOIN` to only include rows where matching data exists in all tables.\n- Use the exact column names and table names as specified in the database schema.\n- Apply the default condition `probability.ranking = 1` for the `probability` table.\n- The `LIMIT` clause ensures that the query returns at most 30 rows, as requested.\n\nThis detailed decomposition plan ensures that the query retrieves the requested information accurately and efficiently.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3267, "completion_tokens": 1094, "total_tokens": 4361, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 1664, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_f0e307537d"}}, "error": null}

Use the `probability` table to filter objects classified as 'asteroid' by the `stamp_classifier` classifier.\n2. Apply the following conditions:\n   - `probability.classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'` (to select the stamp classifier).\n   - `probability.classifier_version = 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'` (to select the specific version of the classifier).\n   - `probability.class_name = 'asteroid'` (to select objects classified as asteroids).\n   - `probability.probability > 0.9` (to select objects with a probability greater than 0.9).\n   - `probability.ranking = 1` (to ensure only the most likely classification is considered).\n3. Select the `oid` column from this filtered result, as it will be used to join with other tables.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: **Join with the `ss_ztf` table to retrieve Solar System object information**\n1. Use the `oid` values from Step 1 to join with the `ss_ztf` table.\n2. Retrieve the following columns from the `ss_ztf` table:\n   - `oid` (identifier of the ZTF object).\n   - `candid` (unique candidate identifier).\n   - `ssdistnr` (distance to the nearest Solar System object).\n   - `ssmagnr` (MPC archive magnitude of the nearest Solar System object).\n   - `ssnamenr` (name of the nearest Solar System object).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: **Join with the `detection` table to retrieve candidate-related information**\n1. Use the `candid` values from Step 2 to join with the `detection` table.\n2. Retrieve the following columns from the `detection` table:\n   - `fid` (filter identifier).\n   - `fwhm` (FWHM from SExtractor).\n   - `ncalib` (number of PS1 calibrators used).\n   - `exptime` (exposure time).\n3. Ensure that the join is performed using the `candid` column, which is common between the `ss_ztf` and `detection` tables.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: **Limit the number of results**\n1. Limit the final result to at most 30 rows using the `LIMIT` clause.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: **Combine all the required columns**\n1. Combine the columns retrieved from the `ss_ztf` and `detection` tables into the final output:\n   - From `ss_ztf`: `oid`, `candid`, `ssdistnr`, `ssmagnr`, `ssnamenr`.\n   - From `detection`: `fid`, `fwhm`, `ncalib`, `exptime`.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: **Order the results (optional)**\n1. If the user does not specify an explicit ordering, no specific `ORDER BY` clause is required. However, if needed, you can order by `probability.probability` in descending order to prioritize the highest probabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: **Final Query Structure**\n1. Use a subquery for filtering the `probability` table (Step 1).\n2. Perform an `INNER JOIN` between the filtered `probability` subquery and the `ss_ztf` table (Step 2).\n3. Perform another `INNER JOIN` between the result of Step 2 and the `detection` table (Step 3).\n4. Select the required columns and apply the `LIMIT` clause (Step 4).\n\n---\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- Ensure that all table and column names are used exactly as they appear in the database schema.\n- Use the default conditions for the `probability` table (`ranking = 1` and `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`).\n- The `LIMIT` clause ensures that at most 30 rows are returned.\n- The query should be optimized by using appropriate indexes (e.g., `ix_probabilities_oid`, `ix_ss_ztf_candid`, and `ix_ndetection_oid`).\n\nThis detailed decomposition plan ensures that the query retrieves the requested information accurately and efficiently.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3267, "completion_tokens": 957, "total_tokens": 4224, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 3200, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_f0e307537d"}}, "error": null}

Retrieve the following columns from the `ss_ztf` table:\n   - `ss_ztf.oid` (identifier of the ZTF object).\n   - `ss_ztf.candid` (unique candidate identifier).\n   - `ss_ztf.ssdistnr` (distance to the nearest Solar System object).\n   - `ss_ztf.ssmagnr` (magnitude of the nearest Solar System object).\n   - `ss_ztf.ssnamenr` (name of the nearest Solar System object).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: **Join with the `detection` table to retrieve candidate-related information**\n1. Use the `candid` values from Step 2 to join with the `detection` table.\n2. Retrieve the following columns from the `detection` table:\n   - `detection.fid` (filter identifier).\n   - `detection.fwhm` (Full Width at Half Maximum from SExtractor).\n   - `detection.ncalib` (number of PS1 calibrators used).\n   - `detection.exptime` (exposure time).\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: **Limit the number of results**\n1. Limit the final output to at most 30 rows using the `LIMIT` clause.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: **Combine all the results into a single query**\n1. Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the results from the `probability`, `ss_ztf`, and `detection` tables.\n2. Ensure that the filtering conditions from Step 1 are applied to the `probability` table.\n3. Ensure that the `oid` from the `probability` table matches the `oid` in the `ss_ztf` table.\n4. Ensure that the `candid` from the `ss_ztf` table matches the `candid` in the `detection` table.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: **Select the required columns**\n1. Include the following columns in the final output:\n   - From the `ss_ztf` table:\n     - `oid` (identifier of the ZTF object).\n     - `candid` (unique candidate identifier).\n     - `ssdistnr` (distance to the nearest Solar System object).\n     - `ssmagnr` (magnitude of the nearest Solar System object).\n     - `ssnamenr` (name of the nearest Solar System object).\n   - From the `detection` table:\n     - `fid` (filter identifier).\n     - `fwhm` (Full Width at Half Maximum from SExtractor).\n     - `ncalib` (number of PS1 calibrators used).\n     - `exptime` (exposure time).\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: **Order the results (optional)**\n1. If the user does not specify an explicit ordering, no specific `ORDER BY` clause is required. However, if needed, you can order by `probability.probability` in descending order to prioritize the highest probabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final Notes:\n- Ensure that all table and column names are used exactly as they appear in the database schema.\n- Use `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables, as this ensures only matching rows are included.\n- Apply the `LIMIT 30` clause to restrict the output to at most 30 rows.\n- The query should be optimized by using the appropriate indexes (e.g., `ix_probabilities_oid`, `ix_ss_ztf_candid`) to improve performance.\n\nThis detailed decomposition plan ensures that the query retrieves the requested information accurately and efficiently.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3267, "completion_tokens": 1041, "total_tokens": 4308, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 1664, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_f0e307537d"}}, "error": null}

Below is the detailed decomposition plan:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: **Filter the `probability` table for asteroid classification**\n1. Start by filtering the `probability` table to retrieve objects classified as 'asteroid' by the `stamp_classifier` with version `stamp_classifier_1.0.4`.\n2. Apply the condition that the `probability` value must be greater than 0.9.\n3. Ensure that only the most likely classification (`ranking = 1`) is considered, as per the default condition for the `probability` table.\n4.

Use the `oid` from the filtered `probability` table to perform an INNER JOIN with the `ss_ztf` table.\n2. Retrieve the following columns from the `ss_ztf` table:\n   - `oid` (identifier of the ZTF object),\n   - `candid` (unique candidate identifier),\n   - `ssdistnr` (distance to the nearest Solar System object),\n   - `ssmagnr` (MPC archive magnitude),\n   - `ssnamenr` (name of the nearest Solar System object).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: **Join with the `detection` table to retrieve candidate-related information**\n1. Use the `candid` column from the `ss_ztf` table to perform an INNER JOIN with the `detection` table.\n2. Retrieve the following columns from the `detection` table:\n   - `fid` (filter identifier),\n   - `fwhm` (Full Width at Half Maximum from SExtractor),\n   - `ncalib` (number of PS1 calibrators used),\n   - `exptime` (exposure time).\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: **Combine the results and limit the output**\n1. Combine the results from the `probability`, `ss_ztf`, and `detection` tables into a single output table.\n2. Ensure that the output includes the following columns:\n   - From `ss_ztf`: `oid`, `candid`, `ssdistnr`, `ssmagnr`, `ssnamenr`.\n   - From `detection`: `fid`, `fwhm`, `ncalib`, `exptime`.\n3. Limit the number of rows in the final output to at most 30.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: **Order the results (optional)**\n1. If no specific ordering is requested, the results can be returned in any order.\n2. Optionally, you may order the results by `probability` in descending order to prioritize the most confident classifications.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: **Final Query Construction**\n1. Use subqueries or INNER JOINs to combine the filtered results from the `probability`, `ss_ztf`, and `detection` tables.\n2. Apply the filtering conditions and column selections as described in the previous steps.\n3. Use the `LIMIT` clause to restrict the output to 30 rows.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- Ensure that the `probability` table filtering includes the conditions `ranking = 1`, `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`, and `classifier_version = 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'`.\n- The `probability` value must be greater than 0.9.\n- Use INNER JOINs to combine the tables based on the relationships:\n  - `probability.oid = ss_ztf.oid`\n  - `ss_ztf.candid = detection.candid`\n- The query should be optimized to avoid unnecessary computations or large intermediate results.\n\nBy following these steps, the query will accurately retrieve the requested information while adhering to the database schema and constraints.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3267, "completion_tokens": 862, "total_tokens": 4129, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 1664, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_f0e307537d"}}, "error": null}

The query involves multiple conditions, joins, and specific columns to retrieve. Below is the detailed decomposition plan:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Tables and Columns Involved**\n1. **`object` table**:\n   - Contains the ZTF object identifier (`oid`), number of detections (`ndet`), first detection date (`firstmjd`), and last detection date (`lastmjd`).\n   - We will filter objects with more than 500 detections (`ndet > 500`).\n   - We will also use `firstmjd` to order the results.\n\n2. **`probability` table**:\n   - Contains classification probabilities for objects (`probability`), the classifier name (`classifier_name`), and the class name (`class_name`).\n   - We will filter objects classified as 'asteroid' in the `stamp_classifier` version 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4' with a probability greater than 0.5.\n\n3. **`ss_ztf` table**:\n   - Contains information about the nearest Solar System object, including the distance (`ssdistnr`), the name of the nearest Solar System object (`ssnamenr`), and the candidate identifier (`candid`).\n   - We will filter objects with a distance (`ssdistnr`) below 2 arcseconds.\n\n4. **`detection` table**:\n   - Contains detection-specific information, including the detection date (`mjd`), filter identifier (`fid`), and candidate identifier (`candid`).\n   - We will retrieve the detection date and filter identifier for the detections.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Define the Query Requirements**\n1. **Conditions**:\n   - `ndet > 500` (from the `object` table).\n   - `probability > 0.5` for `class_name = 'asteroid'` and `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'` with `classifier_version = 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'` (from the `probability` table).\n   - `ssdistnr < 2` (from the `ss_ztf` table).\n\n2. **Columns to Retrieve**:\n   - From the `object` table: `oid` (ZTF identifier), `ndet` (number of detections), `firstmjd` (first detection date), and `lastmjd` (last detection date).\n   - From the `probability` table: `probability`.\n   - From the `ss_ztf` table: `candid` (candidate identifier), `ssdistnr` (distance between ZTF object and MPC object), and `ssnamenr` (MPC name).\n   - From the `detection` table: `mjd` (detection date) and `fid` (filter identifier).\n\n3. **Sorting and Limiting**:\n   - Order the results by `firstmjd` (first detection date).\n   - Limit the results to at most 10 rows.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Decompose the Query into Steps**\n\n#### **Step 3.1: Filter Objects Based on `ndet`**\n- Start by filtering the `object` table to retrieve objects with `ndet > 500`.\n\n#### **Step 3.2: Filter Probabilities for 'asteroid' in `stamp_classifier`**\n- Use the `probability` table to filter rows where:\n  - `class_name = 'asteroid'`\n  - `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`\n  - `classifier_version = 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'`\n  - `probability > 0.5`\n- Ensure that only the most likely probabilities (`ranking = 1`) are considered.\n\n#### **Step 3.3: Filter Solar System Object Distance**\n- Use the `ss_ztf` table to filter rows where `ssdistnr < 2`.\n\n#### **Step 3.4: Join the Filtered Results**\n- Perform an `INNER JOIN` between the filtered results from the `object`, `probability`, and `ss_ztf` tables:\n  - Join `object.oid` with `probability.oid`.\n  - Join `object.oid` with `ss_ztf.oid`.\n\n#### **Step 3.5: Retrieve Detection Information**\n- Use the `detection` table to retrieve the detection date (`mjd`) and filter identifier (`fid`) for the detections.\n- Join `detection.oid` with the filtered `object.oid`.\n\n#### **Step 3.6: Select the Required Columns**\n- Select the following columns:\n  - From `object`: `oid`, `ndet`, `firstmjd`, `lastmjd`.\n  - From `probability`: `probability`.\n  - From `ss_ztf`: `candid`, `ssdistnr`, `ssnamenr`.\n  - From `detection`: `mjd`, `fid`.\n\n#### **Step 3.7: Apply Sorting and Limiting**\n- Order the results by `firstmjd` (ascending).\n- Limit the results to at most 10 rows.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Combine the Steps into a Nested Query**\n1. **Subquery for `object` Table**:\n   - Filter objects with `ndet > 500`.\n\n2. **Subquery for `probability` Table**:\n   - Filter probabilities for 'asteroid' in `stamp_classifier` with `probability > 0.5` and `ranking = 1`.\n\n3. **Subquery for `ss_ztf` Table**:\n   - Filter rows with `ssdistnr < 2`.\n\n4. **Join the Subqueries**:\n   - Perform an `INNER JOIN` between the filtered `object`, `probability`, and `ss_ztf` tables.\n\n5. **Join with `detection` Table**:\n   - Retrieve detection-specific information (`mjd` and `fid`) by joining with the `detection` table.\n\n6. **Select and Order the Results**:\n   - Select the required columns.\n   - Order the results by `firstmjd`.\n   - Limit the results to 10 rows.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Query Description**\n- The final query will:\n  1.

Below is the detailed decomposition plan:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Tables and Columns Involved**\n1. **`object` table**:\n   - Contains the ZTF object identifier (`oid`), number of detections (`ndet`), first detection date (`firstmjd`), and last detection date (`lastmjd`).\n   - We will filter objects with more than 500 detections (`ndet > 500`).\n   - We will also use `firstmjd` to order the results.\n\n2. **`probability` table**:\n   - Contains classification probabilities for objects (`probability`), the classifier name (`classifier_name`), and the class name (`class_name`).\n   - We will filter objects classified as 'asteroid' in the `stamp_classifier` with a probability greater than 0.5 (`probability > 0.5` and `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`).\n   - The specific version of the classifier is `stamp_classifier_1.0.4`.\n\n3. **`ss_ztf` table**:\n   - Contains information about the nearest Solar System object, including the distance (`ssdistnr`), the name of the nearest Solar System object (`ssnamenr`), and the candidate identifier (`candid`).\n   - We will filter objects with a distance below 2 arcseconds (`ssdistnr < 2`).\n\n4. **`detection` table**:\n   - Contains detection-specific information, including the detection date (`mjd`), filter identifier (`fid`), and candidate identifier (`candid`).\n   - We will retrieve the detection date and filter identifier for the detections.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Define the Query Requirements**\n1. **Conditions**:\n   - Objects must have more than 500 detections (`ndet > 500`).\n   - Objects must have a probability greater than 0.5 of being classified as 'asteroid' in the `stamp_classifier` version `stamp_classifier_1.0.4`.\n   - Objects must have a distance from the nearest Solar System object below 2 arcseconds (`ssdistnr < 2`).\n\n2. **Columns to Retrieve**:\n   - From the `object` table: `oid` (ZTF identifier), `ndet` (number of detections), `firstmjd` (first detection date), and `lastmjd` (last detection date).\n   - From the `probability` table: `probability`.\n   - From the `ss_ztf` table: `candid` (candidate identifier), `ssdistnr` (distance between ZTF object and MPC object), and `ssnamenr` (MPC name).\n   - From the `detection` table: `mjd` (detection date) and `fid` (filter identifier).\n\n3. **Sorting and Limiting**:\n   - Order the results by the first detection date (`firstmjd`) in ascending order.\n   - Limit the results to at most 10 objects.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Decompose the Query into Steps**\n\n#### **Step 3.1: Filter Objects Based on Number of Detections**\n- Start by filtering the `object` table to retrieve objects with more than 500 detections (`ndet > 500`).\n\n#### **Step 3.2: Filter Probabilities for 'Asteroid' Classification**\n1. Filter the `probability` table to retrieve rows where:\n   - `class_name = 'asteroid'`\n   - `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`\n   - `classifier_version = 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'`\n   - `probability > 0.5`\n2. Use an INNER JOIN with the filtered `object` table from Step 3.1 to ensure only objects with more than 500 detections are considered.\n\n#### **Step 3.3: Filter Solar System Object Information**\n1. Filter the `ss_ztf` table to retrieve rows where:\n   - `ssdistnr < 2` (distance from the nearest Solar System object is below 2 arcseconds).\n2. Use an INNER JOIN with the results from Step 3.2 to ensure only objects satisfying the previous conditions are included.\n\n#### **Step 3.4: Retrieve Detection Information**\n1. Use the `detection` table to retrieve the detection date (`mjd`) and filter identifier (`fid`) for the objects.\n2. Use an INNER JOIN with the results from Step 3.3 to ensure only relevant detections are included.\n\n#### **Step 3.5: Combine and Select Required Columns**\n- Combine the results from the previous steps to retrieve the following columns:\n  - From the `object` table: `oid`, `ndet`, `firstmjd`, `lastmjd`.\n  - From the `probability` table: `probability`.\n  - From the `ss_ztf` table: `candid`, `ssdistnr`, `ssnamenr`.\n  - From the `detection` table: `mjd`, `fid`.\n\n#### **Step 3.6: Apply Sorting and Limiting**\n- Order the results by `firstmjd` in ascending order.\n- Limit the results to at most 10 rows.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Nested Query and Joins**\n1. **Subquery for `object` Table**:\n   - Filter objects with `ndet > 500`.\n\n2. **Subquery for `probability` Table**:\n   - Filter probabilities for 'asteroid' classification with `probability > 0.5`, `class_name = 'asteroid'`, `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`, and `classifier_version = 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'`.\n   - Join with the filtered `object` table.\n\n3. **Subquery for `ss_ztf` Table**:\n   - Filter rows with `ssdistnr < 2`.\n   - Join with the results from the `probability` subquery.\n\n4. **Subquery for `detection` Table**:\n   - Retrieve detection date (`mjd`) and filter identifier (`fid`).\n   - Join with the results from the `ss_ztf` subquery.\n\n5. **Final Query**:\n   - Combine all subqueries to retrieve the required columns.\n   - Apply sorting by `firstmjd` and limit the results to 10 rows.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Notes**\n- Ensure all joins are INNER JOINs to enforce the conditions at each step.\n- Use the exact column and table names as specified in the database schema.\n- Test the query to verify correctness and performance.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3765, "completion_tokens": 1433, "total_tokens": 5198, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 3712, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_f0e307537d"}}, "error": null}

Here's the detailed decomposition plan:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: **Filter the `ss_ztf` Table for the Specified Solar System Identifiers**\n- Use the `ss_ztf` table to filter rows where the `ssnamenr` column matches either '2003FP134' or '2009UK56'.\n- This will give us the ZTF objects (`oid`) and their associated Solar System identifiers.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: **Retrieve the RA and Dec Coordinates for the Filtered Objects**\n- Use the `detection` table to retrieve the RA (`ra`) and Dec (`dec`) coordinates for the `oid` values obtained in Step 1.\n- Ensure that the `oid` values from the `ss_ztf` table are matched with the `oid` column in the `detection` table using an `INNER JOIN`.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: **Perform a Spatial Query to Find Detections Within 2 Arcseconds**\n- Use the Q3C function `q3c_radial_query` to filter detections that lie within 2 arcseconds of the RA and Dec coordinates of the Solar System identifiers.\n- For each Solar System identifier, perform a spatial query using its RA and Dec coordinates as the center, and a radius of 2 arcseconds.\n- Combine the results for both identifiers using a `UNION` operation.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: **Retrieve the Required Columns from the `detection` Table**\n- For the detections that satisfy the spatial query, retrieve the following columns from the `detection` table:\n  - Detection date (`mjd`)\n  - Filter identifier (`fid`)\n  - Isdiffpos flag (`isdiffpos`)\n  - RA and Dec coordinates (`ra`, `dec`)\n  - Difference magnitude (`magpsf`) and its uncertainty (`sigmapsf`).\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: **Combine the Results with the `ss_ztf` Table**\n- Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the filtered results from the `detection` table (Step 4) with the `ss_ztf` table (Step 1).\n- This will ensure that all detections are associated with their corresponding Solar System identifiers and ZTF objects.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: **Select and Return the Required Columns**\n- Select all columns from the `ss_ztf` table.\n- Include the columns retrieved from the `detection` table in Step 4.\n- Ensure that the results include the Solar System identifier (`ssnamenr`) for clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: **Sort the Results**\n- Sort the final results by the Solar System identifier (`ssnamenr`) and detection date (`mjd`) in ascending order.\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: **Optimize the Query**\n- Use appropriate indexes to optimize the query:\n  - The `ix_ss_ztf_ssnamenr` index on the `ss_ztf` table for filtering by `ssnamenr`.\n  - The `ix_ndetection_oid` index on the `detection` table for joining on `oid`.\n- Ensure that the Q3C spatial query is efficiently executed by leveraging the Q3C extension.\n\n---\n\n### Final Notes:\n- The query will involve multiple `INNER JOIN` operations and a spatial query using the Q3C extension.\n- The `UNION` operation will combine detections for both Solar System identifiers.\n- The results will be sorted as per the user\u2019s request, ensuring clarity and usability.\n\nThis detailed decomposition plan ensures that the query retrieves the requested information accurately and efficiently.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3071, "completion_tokens": 809, "total_tokens": 3880, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 1664, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_f0e307537d"}}, "error": null}

The query involves retrieving detections for ZTF objects that are spatially close to specific Solar System objects, filtering by angular separation, and returning specific columns from the `ss_ztf` and `detection` tables. Below is the detailed decomposition plan:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: **Define the Solar System Objects of Interest**\n- Create a temporary inline table using a `WITH` clause to define the Solar System objects of interest (`2003FP134` and `2009UK56`) along with their coordinates (`ra` and `dec`).\n- This table will be named `catalog` and will include the following columns: `source_id`, `ra`, and `dec`.\n- The `source_id` will store the Solar System object identifiers (`2003FP134` and `2009UK56`), while `ra` and `dec` will store their respective celestial coordinates.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: **Filter the `ss_ztf` Table for Relevant Solar System Objects**\n- Use the `ssnamenr` column in the `ss_ztf` table to filter rows where the Solar System object name matches either `2003FP134` or `2009UK56`.\n- This ensures that we only retrieve rows from `ss_ztf` that are associated with the specified Solar System objects.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: **Perform a Spatial Cross-Match Using Q3C**\n- Use the `q3c_join` function to perform a spatial cross-match between the `catalog` table (created in Step 1) and the `detection` table.\n- The cross-match will identify all detections (`detection.ra`, `detection.dec`) that lie within 2 arcseconds (0.0005556 degrees) of the coordinates of the Solar System objects in the `catalog` table.\n- This step ensures that we only retrieve detections that are spatially close to the specified Solar System objects.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: **Join the Filtered `ss_ztf` and `detection` Tables**\n- Perform an `INNER JOIN` between the filtered `ss_ztf` table (from Step 2) and the `detection` table (from Step 3) using the `oid` column as the common key.\n- This join ensures that we only retrieve detections that are associated with the Solar System objects of interest.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: **Select the Required Columns**\n- From the `ss_ztf` table, select all columns (`SELECT ss_ztf.*`).\n- From the `detection` table, select the following columns:\n  - `mjd` (detection date),\n  - `fid` (filter identifier),\n  - `isdiffpos` (difference flag),\n  - `ra` (right ascension),\n  - `dec` (declination),\n  - `magpsf` (difference magnitude),\n  - `sigmapsf` (uncertainty in difference magnitude).\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: **Sort the Results**\n- Sort the results by the `ssnamenr` column (MPC name) from the `ss_ztf` table and the detection date (`mjd`) from the `detection` table in ascending order.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: **Combine All Steps into a Nested Query**\n- Combine all the above steps into a single query using nested subqueries and `WITH` clauses.\n- Ensure that the spatial filtering (Step 3) and the join (Step 4) are performed efficiently to minimize computational overhead.\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: **Test and Validate the Query**\n- Test the query on a sample dataset to ensure it retrieves the correct results.\n- Validate that the query adheres to the specified requirements, including the column selection, spatial filtering, and sorting.\n\n---\n\nBy following these steps, the query will retrieve all detections for ZTF objects that lie within 2 arcseconds of the specified Solar System objects (`2003FP134` and `2009UK56`), returning the required columns and sorting the results as requested.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3071, "completion_tokens": 863, "total_tokens": 3934, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_f0e307537d"}}, "error": null}

The query involves filtering objects based on conditions from two classifiers (`stamp_classifier` and `lc_classifier_top`), retrieving specific columns, and ordering the results. Below is the detailed decomposition plan:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Tables and Columns Involved**\n1. The `object` table contains the ZTF object identifier (`oid`), the number of detections (`ndet`), and the first detection date (`firstmjd`).\n2. The `probability` table contains classification probabilities for each object, including:\n   - `oid` (foreign key referencing the `object` table),\n   - `class_name` (e.g., 'bogus', 'Transient'),\n   - `classifier_name` (e.g., 'stamp_classifier', 'lc_classifier_top'),\n   - `classifier_version` (e.g., 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'),\n   - `probability` (classification probability),\n   - `ranking` (ranking of the probability, where 1 is the most likely class).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Define the Conditions**\n1. **Condition 1:** Objects must have more than 10 detections (`ndet > 10`), which is a filter on the `object` table.\n2. **Condition 2:** Objects must have a probability larger than 0.7 of being classified as 'bogus' in the `stamp_classifier` with version 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'. This condition applies to the `probability` table with:\n   - `class_name = 'bogus'`,\n   - `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`,\n   - `classifier_version = 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'`,\n   - `probability > 0.7`.\n3. **Condition 3:** Objects must have a probability larger than 0.9 of being classified as 'Transient' in the `lc_classifier_top`. This condition applies to the `probability` table with:\n   - `class_name = 'Transient'`,\n   - `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier_top'`,\n   - `probability > 0.9`.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Retrieve the Required Columns**\nThe query should return the following columns:\n1. `oid` (ZTF identifier) from the `object` table.\n2. `ndet` (number of detections) from the `object` table.\n3. `firstmjd` (first detection date) from the `object` table.\n4. `probability` for the 'bogus' class in the `stamp_classifier` (rename this column as `prob_stamp_bogus`).\n5. `probability` for the 'Transient' class in the `lc_classifier_top` (rename this column as `prob_lc_transient`).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Join the Tables**\n1. Use an `INNER JOIN` between the `object` table and the `probability` table to filter objects based on the conditions in the `probability` table.\n2. Perform two separate subqueries on the `probability` table:\n   - One for the 'bogus' class in the `stamp_classifier`.\n   - Another for the 'Transient' class in the `lc_classifier_top`.\n3. Combine the results of these subqueries using an `INNER JOIN` on the `oid` column to ensure that only objects satisfying both conditions are included.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Apply the Filters**\n1. Filter the `object` table for `ndet > 10`.\n2. Filter the `probability` table for:\n   - `class_name = 'bogus'`, `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`, `classifier_version = 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'`, and `probability > 0.7`.\n   - `class_name = 'Transient'`, `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier_top'`, and `probability > 0.9`.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Limit the Results**\n1. Use the `LIMIT` clause to restrict the output to at most 30 objects.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Order the Results**\n1. Order the results by the ZTF identifier (`oid`) of the objects classified as 'bogus' in the `stamp_classifier`.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Combine the Results**\n1. Use a nested query structure:\n   - The first subquery filters the `probability` table for the 'bogus' class in the `stamp_classifier`.\n   - The second subquery filters the `probability` table for the 'Transient' class in the `lc_classifier_top`.\n   - The main query joins these subqueries with the `object` table and applies the remaining filters and ordering.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 9: Rename Columns**\n1. Rename the `probability` column for the 'bogus' class as `prob_stamp_bogus`.\n2. Rename the `probability` column for the 'Transient' class as `prob_lc_transient`.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 10: Final Query Structure**\n1. Start with the `object` table as the base.\n2. Join the `probability` table twice:\n   - Once for the 'bogus' class in the `stamp_classifier`.\n   - Once for the 'Transient' class in the `lc_classifier_top`.\n3. Apply the filters for `ndet`, `probability`, `class_name`, `classifier_name`, and `classifier_version`.\n4. Select the required columns and rename them as specified.\n5. Order the results by `oid` for the 'bogus' class.\n6.

The query involves filtering objects based on conditions from two classifiers (`stamp_classifier` and `lc_classifier_top`), retrieving specific columns, and ordering the results. Below is the detailed decomposition plan:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Tables and Columns**\n- The `object` table contains the ZTF object identifier (`oid`), number of detections (`ndet`), and first detection date (`firstmjd`).\n- The `probability` table contains classification probabilities for each object, with columns `oid`, `class_name`, `classifier_name`, `classifier_version`, and `probability`.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Define the Conditions**\n1. **Condition 1:** Objects must have more than 10 detections (`ndet > 10`).\n   - This condition is applied to the `object` table.\n2. **Condition 2:** Objects must have a probability larger than 0.7 of being classified as `bogus` in the `stamp_classifier` with version `stamp_classifier_1.0.4`.\n   - This condition is applied to the `probability` table with:\n     - `class_name = 'bogus'`\n     - `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`\n     - `classifier_version = 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'`\n     - `probability > 0.7`\n3. **Condition 3:** Objects must have a probability larger than 0.9 of being classified as `Transient` in the `lc_classifier_top`.\n   - This condition is applied to the `probability` table with:\n     - `class_name = 'Transient'`\n     - `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier_top'`\n     - `probability > 0.9`\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Retrieve the Required Columns**\nThe query must return the following columns:\n- `oid` (ZTF identifier) from the `object` table.\n- `ndet` (number of detections) from the `object` table.\n- `firstmjd` (first detection date) from the `object` table.\n- `probability` for the `bogus` class in the `stamp_classifier` (rename this column as `prob_stamp_bogus`).\n- `probability` for the `Transient` class in the `lc_classifier_top` (rename this column as `prob_lc_transient`).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Join the Tables**\nTo combine the required information:\n1. Start with the `object` table to filter objects with `ndet > 10`.\n2. Join the `probability` table twice:\n   - First, to retrieve the `probability` for the `bogus` class in the `stamp_classifier`.\n   - Second, to retrieve the `probability` for the `Transient` class in the `lc_classifier_top`.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Apply the Filters**\n- Use the conditions defined in Step 2 to filter the results:\n  - `ndet > 10` from the `object` table.\n  - `probability > 0.7` for the `bogus` class in the `stamp_classifier`.\n  - `probability > 0.9` for the `Transient` class in the `lc_classifier_top`.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Rename Columns**\n- Rename the `probability` column for the `bogus` class as `prob_stamp_bogus`.\n- Rename the `probability` column for the `Transient` class as `prob_lc_transient`.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Order the Results**\n- Order the results by the ZTF identifier (`oid`) of objects classified as `bogus` in the `stamp_classifier`.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Limit the Results**\n- Limit the number of results to at most 30 objects.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 9: Detailed Query Construction**\n1. **Subquery for `stamp_classifier`:**\n   - Filter the `probability` table for:\n     - `class_name = 'bogus'`\n     - `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`\n     - `classifier_version = 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'`\n     - `probability > 0.7`\n   - Retrieve `oid` and `probability` (rename as `prob_stamp_bogus`).\n\n2. **Subquery for `lc_classifier_top`:**\n   - Filter the `probability` table for:\n     - `class_name = 'Transient'`\n     - `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier_top'`\n     - `probability > 0.9`\n   - Retrieve `oid` and `probability` (rename as `prob_lc_transient`).\n\n3. **Join Subqueries with `object`:**\n   - Join the `object` table with the subquery for `stamp_classifier` on `oid`.\n   - Join the result with the subquery for `lc_classifier_top` on `oid`.\n\n4. **Apply Filters:**\n   - Ensure `ndet > 10` from the `object` table.\n\n5. **Select Columns:**\n   - Select `oid`, `ndet`, `firstmjd`, `prob_stamp_bogus`, and `prob_lc_transient`.\n\n6. **Order and Limit:**\n   - Order the results by `oid` (from the `stamp_classifier` subquery).\n   - Limit the results to 30 objects.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 10: Final Output**\nThe final query will retrieve at most 30 ZTF objects that satisfy all the conditions, with the specified columns and ordering.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3083, "completion_tokens": 1186, "total_tokens": 4269, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 3072, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_f0e307537d"}}, "error": null}

Rename the `probability` column to `prob_stamp_bogus` for the final output.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Filter probabilities for the light curve classifier top level**\n- Use the `probability` table to filter objects classified as \"Transient\" in the `lc_classifier_top` with the following conditions:\n  - `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier_top'`\n  - `probability.class_name = 'Transient'`\n  - `probability.probability > 0.9`\n  - `probability.ranking = 1` (default condition for the `probability` table).\n- Select the `oid` and `probability` columns from this table. Rename the `probability` column to `prob_lc_transient` for the final output.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Combine the filters using INNER JOINs**\n- Perform an INNER JOIN between the results of Step 1 (from the `object` table) and Step 2 (filtered probabilities for the stamp classifier) on the `oid` column. This ensures that only objects satisfying both conditions are included.\n- Perform another INNER JOIN between the result of the previous join and the results of Step 3 (filtered probabilities for the light curve classifier top level) on the `oid` column. This ensures that only objects satisfying all three conditions are included.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Select the required columns**\n- From the combined result of Step 4, select the following columns for the final output:\n  - `oid` (ZTF identifier)\n  - `ndet` (number of detections)\n  - `firstmjd` (first detection date)\n  - `prob_stamp_bogus` (probability in the stamp classifier for \"bogus\")\n  - `prob_lc_transient` (probability in the light curve classifier top level for \"Transient\")\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Apply ordering and limit the results**\n- Order the results by the `oid` column of objects classified as \"bogus\" in the stamp classifier (`prob_stamp_bogus`).\n- Limit the number of results to at most 30.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Final Query Structure**\n- The final query will involve:\n  - A subquery for Step 1 (filtering objects from the `object` table).\n  - A subquery for Step 2 (filtering probabilities for the stamp classifier).\n  - A subquery for Step 3 (filtering probabilities for the light curve classifier top level).\n  - INNER JOINs to combine the results of the subqueries.\n  - A `SELECT` statement to retrieve the required columns.\n  - An `ORDER BY` clause to sort the results.\n  - A `LIMIT` clause to restrict the number of results to 30.\n\n---\n\nBy following this decomposition plan, the query will accurately retrieve the requested information while adhering to the database schema and conditions.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3083, "completion_tokens": 888, "total_tokens": 3971, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 2304, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_f0e307537d"}}, "error": null}

The query involves multiple tables (`object`, `probability`, and `detection`), filtering conditions, and calculations. Below is the detailed decomposition plan:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: **Identify the Required Columns**\nThe user has requested the following columns:\n- `object identifier` (from the `object` table, column `oid`).\n- `candidate identifier` (from the `detection` table, column `candid`).\n- `filter id` as `f_id` (from the `detection` table, column `fid`).\n- `coordinates` (from the `detection` table, columns `ra` and `dec`).\n- `magnitude` (from the `detection` table, column `magpsf`).\n- `magnitude errors` (from the `detection` table, column `sigmapsf`).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: **Filter Objects Based on Classification**\n- Use the `probability` table to filter objects classified as `CV/Nova` by the `stochastic` light curve classifier (`lc_classifier_stochastic`).\n- Apply the default conditions for the `probability` table:\n  - `probability.ranking = 1` (only the most likely probabilities).\n  - `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier_stochastic'`.\n- Ensure the class name is `CV/Nova`.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: **Filter Objects Based on Number of Detections**\n- Use the `object` table to filter objects with a number of detections (`ndet`) of at most 50. This ensures that only objects with limited detections from discovery to the last detection are included.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: **Filter Detections in the r-band**\n- Use the `detection` table to filter detections in the r-band filter (`fid = 2`).\n- Retrieve the corrected difference magnitude (`magpsf_corr`) for these detections.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: **Calculate Maximum Rise from Minimum in Detections**\n- For each object, calculate the maximum rise in the corrected PSF magnitude (`magpsf_corr`) from the minimum value across all detections in the r-band.\n- This requires grouping detections by `oid` and calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum `magpsf_corr` values.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: **Join Tables**\n- Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `object`, `probability`, and `detection` tables:\n  - Join `probability` with `object` on `oid`.\n  - Join `detection` with `object` on `oid`.\n- Ensure that only objects meeting the classification and detection count criteria are included.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: **Apply Sorting and Limit**\n- Sort the results by `object identifier` (`oid`) in ascending order.\n- Limit the output to the first 1000 rows.\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: **Final Output**\n- The final output should include the following columns:\n  - `oid` (object identifier).\n  - `candid` (candidate identifier).\n  - `fid` as `f_id` (filter id).\n  - `ra` and `dec` (coordinates).\n  - `magpsf` (magnitude).\n  - `sigmapsf` (magnitude errors).\n  - `magpsf_corr` (corrected difference magnitude in the r-band).\n  - Maximum rise in `magpsf_corr` from minimum for each object.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Steps to Generate the Query:\n\n1. **Subquery for Classification Filtering:**\n   - Create a subquery to filter objects classified as `CV/Nova` by the `lc_classifier_stochastic` classifier.\n   - Use the `probability` table with the conditions:\n     - `probability.ranking = 1`.\n     - `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier_stochastic'`.\n     - `probability.class_name = 'CV/Nova'`.\n\n2. **Subquery for Detection Count Filtering:**\n   - Use the `object` table to filter objects with `ndet <= 50`.\n   - Combine this with the classification subquery using an `INNER JOIN` on `oid`.\n\n3. **Subquery for Detections in the r-band:**\n   - Use the `detection` table to filter detections with `fid = 2` (r-band).\n   - Retrieve the required columns: `candid`, `fid` (as `f_id`), `ra`, `dec`, `magpsf`, `sigmapsf`, and `magpsf_corr`.\n\n4. **Calculate Maximum Rise in Corrected Magnitude:**\n   - Group the detections by `oid`.\n   - Calculate the maximum rise in `magpsf_corr` as the difference between the maximum and minimum values of `magpsf_corr` for each object.\n\n5. **Join Tables:**\n   - Join the filtered `object` and `probability` subqueries with the filtered `detection` subquery on `oid`.\n   - Ensure that only objects meeting all criteria are included.\n\n6. **Sort and Limit Results:**\n   - Sort the final results by `oid` in ascending order.\n   - Limit the output to the first 1000 rows.\n\n---\n\nBy following these steps, the query will retrieve the requested information accurately and efficiently.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3609, "completion_tokens": 1131, "total_tokens": 4740, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 2944, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_f0e307537d"}}, "error": null}

Below is the detailed decomposition plan:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: **Identify the Required Columns**\nThe user has requested the following columns:\n- `object identifier` (from the `object` table, column `oid`).\n- `candidate identifier` (from the `detection` table, column `candid`).\n- `filter id` as `f_id` (from the `detection` table, column `fid`).\n- `coordinates` (from the `detection` table, columns `ra` and `dec`).\n- `magnitude` (from the `detection` table, column `magpsf`).\n- `magnitude errors` (from the `detection` table, column `sigmapsf`).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: **Filter Objects Based on Classification**\n- Use the `probability` table to filter objects classified as `CV/Nova` by the `stochastic` light curve classifier (`lc_classifier_stochastic`).\n- Apply the default conditions for the `probability` table:\n  - `probability.ranking = 1` (only the most likely probabilities).\n  - `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier_stochastic'`.\n- Ensure the class name is `CV/Nova`.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: **Filter Objects Based on Number of Detections**\n- Use the `object` table to filter objects with a number of detections (`ndet`) of at most 50.
