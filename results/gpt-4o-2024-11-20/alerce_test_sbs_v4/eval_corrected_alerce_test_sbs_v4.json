Ensured the `probability` table has the required conditions: `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`, `class_name = 'SN'`, and `ranking = 1`.\n-- 4. Limited the scope of the query to only necessary columns and conditions to improve performance.\n-- 5. Added a `LIMIT 100` clause to restrict the number of rows returned, as requested.",
