This may involve:\n     - Checking the classification timestamp or order if available.\n     - Confirming that the object was not previously classified as 'SN' before the specified date range.\n   - Since the user specifies \"first classified as SN,\" identify the earliest classification event for each object where the class is 'SN'.\n\n3. **Apply the date range filter:**\n   - Convert the given date range from calendar dates to MJD:\n     - August 17 corresponds to MJD 60173.0.\n     - August 21 corresponds to MJD 60177.0.\n   - Filter objects whose first classification as 'SN' occurred between these MJDs, inclusive.\n\n4. **Filter by probability:**\n   - Use the `probability` table to select objects where the probability of being 'SN' (or 'SN' class in `stamp_classifier`) exceeds 0.5.\n   - Ensure that the `probability` table is joined with the classification data, filtering for:\n     - `classifier_name='stamp_classifier'`\n     - `class_name='SN'` (or the exact class label used in the database for supernovae)\n     - `ranking=1` (to get the most probable classification)\n     - `probability > 0.5`\n\n5. **Identify objects with at least two detections:**\n   - Use the `object` table to filter objects with `ndet >= 2`.\n   - This ensures objects with at least two detections are included.\n\n6. **Combine the filters:**\n   - Use appropriate JOINs or subqueries to combine:\n     - The classification filter (objects first classified as SN within the date range).\n     - The probability filter (probability > 0.5 for SN classification).\n     - The detection count filter (`ndet >= 2`).\n\n7. **Ensure the classification is the first for the object:**\n   - Confirm that the classification event as SN is the earliest for that object, possibly by:\n     - Comparing the classification date with other classifications for the same object.\n     - Ensuring no earlier classification as SN exists before the date range.\n\n8. **Select the desired columns:**\n   - Use `SELECT *` to retrieve all columns from the relevant tables, or specify particular columns such as object ID, first detection date, classification date, probability, and detection count.\n\n9. **Order and limit the results if necessary:**\n   - Optionally, order the results by first classification date or object ID.\n   - No explicit limit is specified, so retrieve all matching objects.\n\n10. **Document the query logic:**\n    - Clearly specify that the query filters objects first classified as SN by the stamp classifier between August 17 and August 21.\n    - It filters for objects with a classification probability greater than 0.5 or with at least two detections.\n    - It ensures the classification as SN is the first for each object within the date range.\n\nBy following these steps, you will systematically generate a precise and efficient PostgreSQL query that fulfills the user\u2019s request, considering all necessary filters and conditions based on the database schema and domain knowledge.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

If you want to add comments, use the SQL comment format inside the query.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nTo decompose the user request into a systematic series of steps for generating the PostgreSQL query, follow these detailed steps:\n\n1. **Identify the main tables involved:**\n   - The primary table is `object`, which contains the object metadata such as `oid`, `meanra`, `meandec`, `ndet`, `firstmjd`, `deltajd`, and `g_r_max`.\n   - The `probability` table holds the classification probabilities, including `class_name`, `classifier_name`, `ranking`, and `probability`.\n   - The `feature` table contains features related to objects, but since the user specifies classification results, focus on `probability` and `object`.\n\n2. **Filter objects based on detection count:**\n   - Select objects with `ndet >= 100` to ensure objects have at least 100 detections.\n\n3. **Join the `object` and `probability` tables:**\n   - Use the `oid` as the key to join `object` with `probability`.\n   - Filter the `probability` table to include only entries where:\n     - `classifier_name` = 'lc_classifier'\n     - `ranking` = 1 (to get the most likely class per object)\n     - `probability` > 0.76 (to ensure high confidence)\n\n4. **Filter for objects most likely classified as 'cepheid':**\n   - Add a condition where `class_name` = 'CEP' (assuming the class name is exactly 'CEP' as per the database schema).\n\n5. **Filter for objects with the most probable class being 'cepheid':**\n   - Since `ranking=1` is used, the probability corresponds to the most likely class, so filtering `class_name='CEP'` ensures the object is most likely a Cepheid.\n\n6. **Order the results by the probability of being Cepheid:**\n   - Use `ORDER BY probability DESC` to prioritize objects with the highest probability of being Cepheid.\n\n7. **Select only objects with `ndet >= 100`:**\n   - Apply this condition in the `WHERE` clause to filter objects with sufficient detections.\n\n8. **Retrieve the requested columns:**\n   - From the `object` table: `oid`, `meanra`, `meandec`, `ndet`, `firstmjd`, `deltajd`, `g_r_max`.\n   - From the `probability` table: `class_name`, `classifier_name`, `ranking`, `probability`.\n   - For each class of the `lc_classifier`, include the probability columns for all classes:\n     - For classes in `lc_classifier` (e.g., 'SNIa', 'SNIbc', 'SNII', 'SLSN', 'QSO', 'AGN', 'Blazar', 'CV/Nova', 'YSO', 'LPV', 'E', 'DSCT', 'RRL', 'CEP', 'Periodic-Other'), retrieve their probabilities.\n     - This involves joining or subqueries for each class probability, or alternatively, selecting all probability entries for each object and pivoting them in the application layer.\n\n9. **Ensure the query retrieves all class probabilities for each object:**\n   - Since the user wants the probability columns for each class, consider joining the `probability` table multiple times or using a pivoting technique to get each class's probability as a separate column.\n\n10. **Order the final results:**\n    - Order by `probability` of the 'CEP' class in descending order to get the most likely Cepheids at the top.\n\n11. **Limit the results if necessary:**\n    - If the user wants only the top objects, add a `LIMIT` clause; otherwise, retrieve all qualifying objects.\n\n12. **Document the query structure:**\n    - Use clear comments to explain joins, filters, and the selection of probability columns for each class.\n\nThis systematic decomposition ensures the query will accurately retrieve the objects classified as Cepheids with high confidence, sufficient detections, and include all relevant classification probabilities for each class.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Return the oids, meanra, meandec, ndet, firstmjd, deltajd, g_r_max, the classifier and class name, the ranking and the probability columns for each class of each object classified by the lc_classifier, with 100 or more detections that are most likely to be cepheid, with a probability larger than 0.76.

This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nTo decompose the user request into a systematic plan for generating the PostgreSQL query, follow these detailed steps:\n\n1. **Identify the main tables involved:**\n   - The `object` table for retrieving object-level information such as `oid`, `meanra`, `meandec`, `ndet`, and observation time span.\n   - The `probability` table to filter objects classified as 'AGN' with a probability > 0.6, ensuring the `classifier_name` is 'lc_classifier' and `ranking` is 1.\n   - The `feature` table to extract features related to the light curve variations, specifically for features like maximum and minimum magnitudes, and the magnitude variations in the g and r bands.\n   - The `detection` table to verify the number of detections and the coverage time span of the light curves.\n\n2. **Filter objects based on classification and probability:**\n   - Use the `probability` table to select objects where `class_name='AGN'`, `probability > 0.6`, `classifier_name='lc_classifier'`, and `ranking=1`.\n   - Join this filtered set with the `object` table on `oid` to retrieve object-level details.\n\n3. **Ensure light curves cover at least one year:**\n   - Calculate the time span of each object\u2019s observations using `mjdstarthist` and `mjdendhist` from the `object` table.\n   - Filter objects where `(mjdendhist - mjdstarthist) >= 365` days.\n\n4. **Verify the number of detections:**\n   - Use the `ndet` column from the `object` table to select objects with `ndet >= 20`.\n\n5. **Check for sufficient detections in at least one band:**\n   - Use the `detection` table to count detections per `oid` and per filter (`fid`).\n   - Filter objects that have at least 20 detections in any one band (filter id 1 for g, 2 for r).\n\n6. **Retrieve features related to magnitude variations:**\n   - From the `feature` table, extract features for the object with `name` corresponding to:\n     - Maximum corrected magnitude in g band (`max_mag_g`), with `name='max_mag'`, `fid=1`, `version` as per the latest or specified.\n     - Minimum corrected magnitude in g band (`min_mag_g`), with `name='min_mag'`, `fid=1`.\n     - Maximum corrected magnitude in r band (`max_mag_r`), with `name='max_mag'`, `fid=2`.\n     - Minimum corrected magnitude in r band (`min_mag_r`), with `name='min_mag'`, `fid=2`.\n   - Calculate the magnitude variations (`delta_mag`) as the difference between maximum and minimum magnitudes for each band.\n\n7. **Calculate the variations in the bands:**\n   - For each object, compute:\n     - `delta_mag_g` = `max_mag_g` - `min_mag_g`\n     - `delta_mag_r` = `max_mag_r` - `min_mag_r`\n   - Filter objects where `delta_mag_g > 1` and `delta_mag_r > 0.5`.\n\n8. **Select and return the required columns:**\n   - `oid` from the `object` table.\n   - The feature values: `value`, `name`, `version`, `fid` from the `feature` table, filtered for the relevant features.\n   - The mean coordinates: `meanra`, `meandec` from the `object` table.\n   - The number of detections: `ndet` from the `object` table.\n   - The maximum and minimum magnitudes in g and r bands.\n   - The computed `delta_mag_g` and `delta_mag_r`.\n   - The filter id columns with alias `[table_name]_fid`, e.g., `features_g_fid`, `features_r_fid`.\n\n9. **Implement subqueries and joins:**\n   - Use subqueries to filter objects based on probability, time coverage, and detection counts.\n   - Use INNER JOINs to connect `object`, `probability`, `feature`, and `detection` tables.\n   - Use aggregation functions to determine max/min magnitudes and detection counts per object and per band.\n\n10. **Order and limit the results if necessary:**\n    - Order by relevant parameters if needed, or return all matching objects.\n\n11. **Test the query for correctness and efficiency:**\n    - Ensure all filters are correctly applied.\n    - Verify that the joins are optimized and indexes are used effectively.\n\nThis systematic decomposition ensures that the final SQL query will accurately retrieve all objects classified as AGN with the specified probability, light curve coverage, detection counts, and magnitude variation criteria, including all necessary details and aliases.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Get all the objects classified as AGN with a probability larger than 0.6, with light curves covering at least one year that have at least 20 detections at least in one band, and select those that show variations larger than 1 magnitude in the g band and larger than 0.5 in the r band.

The `object` table for object identifiers and basic statistics.\n   - The `probability` table for the stamp classifier probabilities.\n   - The `detection` table for light curve data, including detections and non-detections.\n   - The `magstat` table for magnitude statistics per filter.\n   - The `stamp_classifier` table (if needed) for class labels, but since probabilities are used, focus on the `probability` table.\n   \n2. **Filter objects based on the stamp classifier:**\n   - Select objects where the highest probability in the `stamp_classifier` is for class `'SN'`.\n   - Use the `probability` table filtered by `classifier_name='stamp_classifier'` and `ranking=1` (most probable class).\n   - Ensure the class with the highest probability is `'SN'` by filtering for `class_name='SN'` and the maximum probability per object.\n\n3. **Identify objects with their maximum probability in the stamp classifier:**\n   - For each object, find the maximum probability value in the `probability` table where `classifier_name='stamp_classifier'` and `ranking=1`.\n   - Filter objects where this maximum probability is associated with class `'SN'`.\n\n4. **Filter objects with their first detection within the first 2 days of September:**\n   - Use the `object` table's `firstmjd` column.\n   - Select objects where `firstmjd` is between 60188.0 and 60190.0 (inclusive).\n\n5. **Determine objects that qualify as fast risers:**\n   - For each object, analyze the `detection` table:\n     - Find the first detection (minimum `mjd`) for that object.\n     - Find the last non-detection before the first detection:\n       - Identify the detection immediately preceding the first detection (by `mjd`).\n       - Check the `isdiffpos` value for the last non-detection (where `isdiffpos=0` or as per data convention).\n     - Calculate the rate of initial brightness change:\n       - Compute the difference in magnitude (`magpsf`) between the first detection and the last non-detection.\n       - Compute the time difference in days between these two events.\n       - Determine if the rate of change is at least 0.25 magnitudes/day.\n     - Confirm the object qualifies as a fast riser if the rate condition is met.\n\n6. **Retrieve non-detections for the qualifying objects:**\n   - From the `detection` table, select entries where `oid` matches the qualifying objects.\n   - Filter for non-detections (`isdiffpos=0`).\n   - For each, retrieve:\n     - `candid` (candidate ID)\n     - `magpsf` (difference magnitude)\n     - `fid` (filter ID)\n     - `diffmaglim` (difference magnitude limit)\n     - The `magstat` table for each object and filter:\n       - Join on `oid` and `fid`.\n       - Retrieve `magstat` fields, including `magstat_fid` (filter ID in `magstat`) and the initial rise estimate (which can be derived from the magnitude change over time).\n\n7. **Calculate the initial rise estimate:**\n   - For each object, estimate the initial rise as the difference in magnitude divided by the time difference (in days) between the last non-detection and the first detection.\n   - This provides the rate of brightness increase, which should be at least 0.25 mag/day for fast risers.\n\n8. **Order and limit the results:**\n   - Order the final result set by `oid`.\n   - Limit the output to 100 rows.\n\n9. **Construct the final query structure:**\n   - Use subqueries or Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to:\n     - Filter objects based on class and first detection date.\n     - Identify fast risers based on the magnitude change rate.\n     - Join with `detection` for non-detections.\n     - Join with `magstat` for additional magnitude info.\n   - Select the required columns:\n     - `oid`\n     - Maximum probability in the stamp classifier\n     - For each non-detection: `candid`, `magpsf`, `fid`, `diffmaglim`\n     - The `magstat_fid` (filter ID from `magstat`)\n     - The initial rise estimate (computed as magnitude change over time)\n\n10. **Ensure all filters and conditions are applied:**\n    - Use the `probability` table with `ranking=1` and `classifier_name='stamp_classifier'`.\n    - Confirm the class is `'SN'`.\n    - Confirm the first detection date is within the specified range.\n    - Confirm the brightness increase rate exceeds 0.25 mag/day.\n    - Limit the results to 100 entries ordered by `oid`.\n\nThis detailed decomposition ensures that the final SQL query will accurately retrieve the objects matching all specified criteria, including class, detection timing, and rapid brightness increase, along with relevant non-detection data and magnitude statistics.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n# If you need to use 2 tables, try using a INNER JOIN statement, or a sub-query over 'probability' or 'object', if the query requires it. It is important to be really careful with the use of sub-queries or JOINs, as they can slow down the query.\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Answer ONLY with the final SQL query, with the following format: \n  ```sql SQL_QUERY_HERE ```\nDON'T include anything else in your answer. If you want to add comments, use the SQL comment format inside the query.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nTo decompose the user request into a systematic plan for generating the PostgreSQL query, follow these detailed steps:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant tables and columns:**\n   - Main object information is stored in the `object` table, including `oid`, `meanra`, `meandec`, `ndet`, `firstmjd`.\n   - Classification probabilities are stored in the `probability` table, linked via `oid`, with columns `class_name`, `probability`.\n   - The classification label (e.g., 'SN', 'asteroid') is in `probability.class_name`.\n   - The classification probability threshold is 0.7.\n   - The `stamp_classifier` table indicates the classifier used; ensure the classification is from the stamp classifier.\n\n2. **Define the date range filter:**\n   - Convert the date range into MJD:\n     - Start date: March 1, 2021 = 59274.0\n     - End date: April 1, 2021 = 59305.0\n   - Filter objects with `firstmjd` between 59274.0 and 59305.0.\n\n3. **Filter objects based on detection count:**\n   - Select objects with `ndet` less than or equal to 1, indicating at most one detection.\n   - This ensures the objects are only observed once within the date range, aligning with the asteroid movement criterion.\n\n4. **Filter objects classified as asteroids with high confidence:**\n   - Join the `object` table with the `probability` table on `oid`.\n   - Filter for `probability.class_name = 'asteroid'`.\n   - Filter for `probability.classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`.\n   - Filter for `probability.probability > 0.7`.\n   - Ensure that only the most probable classification is considered, which is already enforced by `probability.ranking = 1`.\n\n5. **Ensure the classification is from the stamp classifier:**\n   - Confirm that the `probability` entries are from the `stamp_classifier` by filtering `classifier_name`.\n\n6. **Select the required columns:**\n   - `oid`, `meanra`, `meandec`, `ndet`, `firstmjd`, `class_name`, `probability`.\n\n7. **Construct the query logic:**\n   - Use `JOIN` between `object` and `probability` on `oid`.\n   - Apply all filters in the `WHERE` clause.\n   - Select the specified columns.\n\n8. **Optional: Ensure objects are only those that appear once:**\n   - Since `ndet` is already filtered to \u2264 1, this condition is satisfied.\n   - No additional filtering needed for movement, as objects with only one detection are unlikely to be asteroids moving across the sky within the date range.\n\n9. **Finalize the query:**\n   - Use `SELECT` with the specified columns.\n   - Use `FROM` with the `object` table joined with `probability`.\n   - Apply all filters in the `WHERE` clause.\n\nThis systematic breakdown ensures the query will accurately retrieve objects that meet all specified criteria, including detection count, classification confidence, and date range, with the correct columns.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: \n-- mjd date for March 1st 2021 = 59274.0\n-- mjd date for April 1st 2021 = 59305.0\nDomain Knowledge: -- Asteroids move, so it is necessary to choose those than appear only once.\n # User Request: ''Write a script in PostgreSQL that return objects which appeared between march 1st and april 1st of 2021, which have at most one detection, and which are classified as asteroids by the stamp classifier with a probability greater than 0.7.

Ensure that the classification is the most probable (`ranking = 1`) and from the `lc_classifier` classifier.\n\n2. **Filter by First Occurrence Date:**\n   - Set a condition on the `firstmjd` column to be between 59988.0 and 60197.0, corresponding to February 13 and September 10, respectively.\n   - This ensures only objects that first appeared within this date range are selected.\n\n3. **Filter by Classification as Supernovae:**\n   - Join the `object` table with the `probability` table on the `oid` column.\n   - Filter the `probability` table to include only entries where:\n     - `classifier_name` is `'lc_classifier'`.\n     - `ranking` is 1, indicating the most probable classification.\n     - `class_name` is `'SN'` or the exact class name used for supernovae in the database (if specified differently, confirm the exact string; assuming `'SN'` here).\n\n4. **Spatial Filtering within the Polygon:**\n   - Use the `q3c_poly_query` function to filter objects based on their `meanra` and `meandec`.\n   - Define the polygon with the coordinates `((-20, -20), (-2, -20), (20, 1), (10, 10))`.\n   - Apply the spatial filter to select only objects whose mean positions fall within this polygon.\n\n5. **Select the Required Columns:**\n   - Retrieve the `oid`, `meanra`, and `meandec` columns from the `object` table for the filtered objects.\n\n6. **Construct the Query:**\n   - Use a `WITH` clause or subquery if needed for clarity, but primarily focus on joining and filtering.\n   - Ensure the query is optimized by applying filters early and using indexes on `firstmjd`, `oid`, and spatial functions.\n\n7. **Final Output:**\n   - Return the list of object identifiers (`oids`) along with their mean right ascension (`meanra`) and mean declination (`meandec`).\n\nBy following these steps, the resulting query will accurately retrieve all supernovae that first appeared within the specified date range and are located within the defined polygon, providing the requested information.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n# If you need to use 2 tables, try using a INNER JOIN statement, or a sub-query over 'probability' or 'object', if the query requires it.

If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Answer ONLY with the final SQL query, with the following format: \n  ```sql SQL_QUERY_HERE ```\nDON'T include anything else in your answer. If you want to add comments, use the SQL comment format inside the query.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nTo decompose the user request into a systematic plan for generating the PostgreSQL query, follow these detailed steps:\n\n1. **Identify the input objects and their coordinates:**\n   - Define the first reference object with identifier 'id_1' and coordinates RA=354.67\u00b0, Dec=15.954\u00b0, and search radius of 30 arcseconds.\n   - Define the second reference object with identifier 'id_2' and coordinates RA=20.7993\u00b0, Dec=1.00331\u00b0, and search radius of 20 arcseconds.\n\n2. **Convert search radii from arcseconds to degrees:**\n   - For the first object: 30 arcsec / 3600 = 0.0083333 degrees.\n   - For the second object: 20 arcsec / 3600 = 0.0055556 degrees.\n\n3. **Use the Q3C spatial functions to perform cone searches:**\n   - For each reference object, formulate a spatial query that retrieves all ZTF objects within the specified radius.\n   - Use the `q3c_radial_query` function with the reference RA, Dec, and the radius in degrees.\n   - Combine these two spatial queries with a logical OR to include objects within either of the two specified regions.\n\n4. **Construct a temporary inline table (WITH clause) for the reference objects:**\n   - Create a CTE (Common Table Expression) named, for example, `ref_objects`, containing the identifiers, RA, Dec, and search radius in degrees for each reference object.\n   - This allows for a clean and flexible way to reference the input objects in subsequent spatial queries.\n\n5. **Retrieve ZTF objects that satisfy the spatial conditions:**\n   - Query the `object` table to select objects that are within the specified radii of either reference object.\n   - Use the `q3c_radial_query` function in the WHERE clause, joining with the `ref_objects` CTE to access each reference's coordinates and radius.\n\n6. **Aggregate information for each ZTF object:**\n   - For each selected object, compute:\n     - The number of detections (`ndet`).\n     - The mean RA (`meanra`) and mean Dec (`meandec`) across all detections.\n     - The date of the first detection (`firstmjd`).\n   - To do this, join the `object` table with the `detection` table on `oid`.\n   - Use aggregate functions: `COUNT(*)` for detections, `AVG(ra)` and `AVG(dec)` for mean coordinates, and `MIN(mjd)` for the earliest detection date.\n\n7. **Select the output columns:**\n   - For the input objects:\n     - Identifier (the reference object ID).\n     - Coordinates (RA, Dec).\n     - Search radius used (in degrees).\n   - For the retrieved ZTF objects:\n     - ZTF object identifier (`oid`).\n     - Number of detections (`ndet`).\n     - Mean RA and Dec (`meanra`, `meandec`).\n     - First detection date (`firstmjd`).\n\n8. **Sort the final results:**\n   - Order the output by the first detection date (`firstmjd`) in descending order, so the most recent first detection appears first.\n\n9. **Ensure the query handles multiple objects and spatial overlaps correctly:**\n   - Use appropriate JOINs and WHERE conditions to combine the spatial filters.\n   - Avoid duplicate entries if an object falls within both search regions; consider using `DISTINCT` if necessary.\n\n10. **Test and validate the query:**\n    - Verify that the spatial filters correctly identify objects within the specified radii.\n    - Confirm that the aggregation functions produce accurate summaries.\n    - Check that the sorting order is correct.\n\nThis systematic decomposition ensures the query is precise, efficient, and adheres to the database schema and spatial query capabilities.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Find all ZTF objects that lie within 30 arcsec of an object called id_1, that has coordinates (RA, Dec) = (354.67, 15.954) deg, or within 20 arcsec of  an object called id_2, having coordinates (RA, Dec) = (20.7993, 1.00331) deg.

For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Find at most 200 ZTF objects that satisfy the following conditions: have a distance to the nearest PS1 source larger than 5 arcsec, and have a probability larger than 0.7 of being in a class other than supernova in the light curve classifier.

For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Find at most 10 ZTF objects that have a first detection date later than mjd=60310 days, as well as a probability of 1 of being an asteroid in the stamp classifier, ordered by the first detection date.

If you want to add comments, use the SQL comment format inside the query.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nTo generate a PostgreSQL query that retrieves all relevant information based on the user's request, follow these detailed steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Tables and Relevant Columns:**\n   - Recognize that the user wants data from the 'probability' table and the 'light curve classifier' data, which is stored in the 'probability' table with the 'classifier_name' indicating the classifier used.\n   - The 'probability' table contains columns: 'oid', 'class_name', 'classifier_name', 'classifier_version', 'probability', and 'ranking'.\n   - The 'oid' column in 'probability' references the object identifier, which should match the ZTF identifiers provided.\n\n2. **Filter by Object Identifiers:**\n   - Use the list of ZTF identifiers ('ZTF21aaobkmg', 'ZTF21aaomuka') to filter the 'oid' column.\n   - Since multiple identifiers are involved, implement an 'IN' clause to match any of these identifiers.\n\n3. **Apply the Ranking Condition:**\n   - Filter the 'probability' table to include only rows where 'ranking' is either 1 or 2, as specified by the user.\n   - This involves adding a condition on the 'ranking' column with an 'IN' clause for values 1 and 2.\n\n4. **Filter by Classifier Name:**\n   - Ensure that only entries from the 'light curve classifier' are retrieved.\n   - According to the context, the classifier name for the light curve classifier is 'lc_classifier'.\n   - Add a condition to filter 'classifier_name' to be 'lc_classifier'.\n\n5. **Select All Columns:**\n   - The user requests all columns from the 'probability' table for the filtered rows.\n   - Use 'SELECT *' to retrieve all columns.\n\n6. **Sort the Results:**\n   - Order the results by the 'ranking' column in ascending order to meet the user's requirement.\n   - This will display the most probable classifications first, with ranking 1 at the top.\n\n7. **Construct the Query Logic:**\n   - Combine all the above filters into a single query.\n   - Use appropriate syntax to ensure the query is efficient and accurate, with proper filtering and sorting.\n\n8. **Optional: Consider the 'object' Table:**\n   - If additional object information is needed, plan to join with the 'object' table using the 'oid' key.\n   - However, since the user only requests data from the 'probability' table, this step is optional unless further details are needed.\n\n9. **Verify the Query Conditions:**\n   - Confirm that the conditions match the user's request precisely:\n     - Object identifiers are in the specified list.\n     - 'ranking' is 1 or 2.\n     - 'classifier_name' is 'lc_classifier'.\n   - Ensure the sorting is correctly implemented by 'ranking'.\n\n10. **Prepare for Execution:**\n    - Finalize the query structure, ensuring all conditions are correctly combined with 'AND' operators.\n    - Confirm that the syntax aligns with PostgreSQL standards.\n\nBy following these steps, you will systematically construct a precise and efficient query that retrieves all relevant rows from the 'probability' table for the specified ZTF objects, filtered by ranking and classifier, and sorted appropriately.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''For objects with ZTF identifiers 'ZTF21aaobkmg', 'ZTF21aaomuka', find all rows in the 'probability' table and light curve classifier that have ranking 1 or 2.

Since the `object` table has a `corrected` boolean, use that to filter out dubious corrections.\n\n3. **Ensure detections are in the g band:**\n   - Use the `detection` table, filtering for `fid = 1` (g band).\n   - Count the number of such detections per object, ensuring the count is at least 10.\n\n4. **Join the relevant tables:**\n   - Join the `object` table with the `detection` table on `oid`.\n   - Join the `object` table with the `probability` table on `oid`.\n   - Filter the `probability` table to include only entries where `classifier_name='lc_classifier'`, `ranking=1`, and the class is any of the 15 classes (or all, if not specified).\n\n5. **Select the required columns:**\n   - ZTF identifier: from `object.oid`.\n   - Classifier version: from `probability.classifier_version`.\n   - Class name: from `probability.class_name`.\n   - Probability: from `probability.probability`.\n\n6. **Order and limit the results:**\n   - Order the results by `oid` in ascending order.\n   - Limit the total number of results to 500.\n\n7. **Additional considerations:**\n   - Ensure only objects with no dubious corrections are included, which may involve filtering on `corrected = TRUE`.\n   - Since the user specifies \"no dubious corrections,\" interpret this as objects with `corrected = TRUE` and no indication of dubiousness, which is not explicitly stored in the `object` table, so rely on `corrected` boolean.\n   - Confirm that only probabilities with `ranking=1` are included, as per the user request.\n\n8. **Construct the query with all filters and joins:**\n   - Use subqueries or CTEs if necessary to first filter objects with the detection count criteria.\n   - Join with the `probability` table to get the classification info.\n   - Apply all filters in the `WHERE` clause to ensure correctness.\n\nBy following these steps, the resulting query will accurately retrieve up to 500 ZTF objects with at least 10 detections in the g band, no dubious corrections, and the most probable classification with its version and probability, ordered by their identifiers.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

If you want to add comments, use the SQL comment format inside the query.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nTo decompose the user request into a systematic series of steps for generating the PostgreSQL query, follow this detailed plan:\n\n1. **Identify the main tables involved:**\n   - The `object` table, which contains the main statistics and identifiers for each ZTF object.\n   - The `detection` table, which records individual detections, including filter information and detection quality.\n   - The `probability` table, which holds classification probabilities, including class names, classifier details, and rankings.\n\n2. **Establish the filtering criteria:**\n   - Select objects with at least 10 detections in the g band:\n     - Filter detections where `fid` corresponds to the g band (typically `fid=1`).\n     - Count the number of such detections per object.\n     - Only include objects where this count is \u2265 10.\n   - Exclude objects with dubious corrections in the g band:\n     - Check the `corrected` and `dubious` flags in the `detection` table.\n     - Ensure that for detections in the g band, `corrected` is true and `dubious` is false.\n   - Limit the total number of objects to at most 500:\n     - Order the resulting objects by their `oid` in ascending order.\n     - Use a limit clause to restrict the output to 500 objects.\n\n3. **Join the relevant tables:**\n   - Join the `object` table with the `detection` table on `oid`.\n   - Filter detections to only those in the g band (`fid=1`), with `corrected=true`, and `dubious=false`.\n   - Group detections by `oid` to count the number of g-band detections per object.\n   - Filter groups where the count of g-band detections is \u2265 10.\n\n4. **Retrieve classification probabilities:**\n   - Join the filtered objects with the `probability` table on `oid`.\n   - Filter the `probability` table to include only entries where:\n     - `classifier_name='lc_classifier'`\n     - `ranking=1` (most likely class)\n   - Join with the classification class name, which is stored in `class_name`.\n   - Retrieve the `probability` value, the `classifier_version`, and the `class_name`.\n\n5. **Select the output columns:**\n   - The ZTF object identifier (`oid`).\n   - The classifier version (`classifier_version`).\n   - The class name (`class_name`).\n   - The probability (`probability`).\n\n6. **Order and limit the results:**\n   - Order the final results by `oid` in ascending order.\n   - Limit the output to 500 entries.\n\n7. **Ensure all conditions are explicitly applied:**\n   - Confirm that only probabilities with `ranking=1` are included.\n   - Confirm that only the most recent or relevant classifier version is considered if necessary (not specified, so include all versions).\n\n8. **Optional optimization considerations:**\n   - Use indexes on `detection.oid`, `detection.fid`, `probability.oid`, and `probability.ranking` for efficient filtering.\n   - Use subqueries or CTEs if needed to improve readability and performance, especially for counting detections.\n\nThis step-by-step plan ensures that the query accurately filters objects based on the number of g-band detections, excludes dubious corrections, and retrieves the top 500 objects ordered by their `oid`, with the specified classification details.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Find at most 500 ZTF objects ordered by their oids that have as a minimum 10 detections in the g band, and have no dubious corrections in that filter.

If you want to add comments, use the SQL comment format inside the query.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nTo decompose the user request into a systematic plan for generating the PostgreSQL query, follow these detailed steps:\n\n1. **Identify the main tables involved:**\n   - The `object` table, which contains object identifiers (`oid`) and basic object information.\n   - The `probability` table, which holds classification probabilities, linked to objects via `oid`.\n   - The `magstat` table, which contains magnitude statistics, also linked via `oid`.\n   - The `magstat` table includes WISE W1 magnitudes, which are stored in a specific band identified by `fid`.\n\n2. **Determine the filtering criteria:**\n   - Classification probability:\n     - Filter the `probability` table for entries where `class_name` is `'AGN'`.\n     - Filter for `classifier_name` equal to `'lc_classifier'`.\n     - Filter for `probability` greater than 0.6.\n     - Filter for `ranking` equal to 1, to ensure the most probable classification.\n   - Magnitude range:\n     - Filter the `magstat` table for `fid` corresponding to the WISE W1 band (identify the correct `fid` value, typically 2 for r-band, but WISE W1 may have a specific `fid` value, e.g., 4 or 5; confirm based on schema or assume the correct `fid` for WISE W1).\n     - Filter for `magmean` (or `magmean_corr` if corrected magnitudes are preferred) between 12 and 13.\n   - Object count:\n     - Limit the total number of objects returned to at most 50.\n\n3. **Establish the join relationships:**\n   - Join the `probability` table with the `object` table on `probability.oid = object.oid`.\n   - Join the `magstat` table with the `object` table on `magstat.oid = object.oid`.\n   - Ensure that the `magstat` entry corresponds to the WISE W1 band by filtering on `fid`.\n\n4. **Construct the filtering conditions:**\n   - Apply the probability filter: `probability.class_name = 'AGN'`, `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`, `probability.ranking = 1`, `probability.probability > 0.6`.\n   - Apply the magnitude filter: `magstat.fid` equals the WISE W1 band identifier, and `magstat.magmean` (or `magmean_corr`) between 12 and 13.\n   \n5. **Select the desired columns:**\n   - Retrieve all columns from the `magstat` table for the objects that meet the criteria.\n\n6. **Limit the number of results:**\n   - Use a `LIMIT 50` clause to restrict the output to at most 50 objects.\n\n7. **Order the results (optional):**\n   - Optionally, order by a relevant column such as `magstat.magmean` or `magstat.firstmjd` to organize the output, but this is not explicitly required.\n\n8. **Ensure the query is efficient:**\n   - Use appropriate indexes on `oid`, `class_name`, `classifier_name`, `probability`, and `fid` to optimize filtering and joining.\n\n9. **Document the query logic:**\n   - Clearly specify that the query filters for objects with high probability of being an AGN, with specific magnitude constraints, and limits the output to 50 objects.\n\nBy following these steps, the resulting query will accurately retrieve up to 50 ZTF objects classified as likely AGN with the specified WISE W1 magnitude range, returning all relevant magnitude statistics.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Find at most 50 ZTF objects that satisfy the following conditions: have a probability larger than 0.6 of being an AGN in the light curve classifier, and a WISE W1 magnitude between 12 and 13.

If not, this step may need adjustment.\n     - Number of PS1 calibrators used (`nmtchps`) from the `ps1_ztf` table, joined on `oid`.\n     - Exposure time \u2014 typically stored in `pid` or possibly in `detection` or `exposure` tables if available.\n\n10. **Construct the query with proper joins:**\n    - Join `probability` with `object` on `oid`.\n    - Join with `ss_ztf` on `oid`.\n    - Join with `reference` on `oid` and `candid`.\n    - Join with `detection` on `oid` to get filter, FWHM, and exposure time.\n    - Join with `ps1_ztf` on `oid` to get the number of PS1 calibrators.\n\n11. **Select the required columns:**\n    - Object identifier (`oid`)\n    - Candidate identifier (`candid`)\n    - Distance to nearest Solar System object (`ssdistnr`)\n    - MPC archive magnitude (`magnr`)\n    - Name of the nearest Solar System object (`ssnamenr`)\n    - Filter identifier (`fid`)\n    - FWHM (if available)\n    - Number of PS1 calibrators (`nmtchps`)\n    - Exposure time (`pid` or relevant field)\n\n12. **Order and limit the results:**\n    - Order by probability descending to prioritize the highest probability objects.\n    - Limit the output to 30 entries.\n\n13. **Ensure the query adheres to the specified conditions:**\n    - Use the exact class name `'asteroid'`.\n    - Use the classifier version `'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'`.\n    - Use `ranking=1` and `probability > 0.9`.\n    - Use `classifier_name='stamp_classifier'`.\n\n14. **Test and validate the query:**\n    - Verify that the joins are correct.\n    - Confirm that the columns exist and are correctly referenced.\n    - Check that the filters produce the expected subset of objects.\n\nThis systematic decomposition ensures the final query will accurately retrieve up to 30 ZTF objects with a high probability of being asteroids, including all specified details, while respecting the database schema and constraints.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

If the 'ss_ztf' table does not directly contain RA/Dec, consider cross-referencing with the 'object' table or other sources if available.\n   - If the coordinates are not directly stored, and only the 'ssnamenr' is available, consider that the 'ssnamenr' is the MPC name, and the coordinates might be stored elsewhere or need to be retrieved from an external source. For this task, assume the 'ss_ztf' table contains or can be joined with the 'object' table to get RA/Dec.\n\n3. **Use Q3C Spatial Functions for Cone Search:**\n   - For each SSO coordinate, perform a cone search with a radius of 2 arcseconds (which is 2/3600 degrees).\n   - Use the 'q3c_radial_query' function to find all objects in the 'detection' table whose RA and Dec are within 2 arcseconds of each SSO's coordinates.\n\n4. **Join Detections with the 'detection' Table:**\n   - For each SSO coordinate, find all detections where the RA and Dec satisfy the cone search condition.\n   - Retrieve the detection details: detection date ('mjd'), filter identifier ('fid'), 'isdiffpos' flag, RA, Dec, difference magnitude ('magpsf'), and its uncertainty ('sigmapsf').\n\n5. **Join with 'ss_ztf' for SSO Information:**\n   - For each detection, join with the 'ss_ztf' table on the 'oid' to get all columns from 'ss_ztf', which include the MPC name and other relevant info.\n\n6. **Combine Results for Both SSOs:**\n   - Repeat the above process for both '2003FP134' and '2009UK56'.\n   - Use a UNION ALL to combine the results from both SSOs.\n\n7. **Sort the Final Results:**\n   - Order the combined results by the MPC name ('ssnamenr') and detection date ('mjd').\n\n8. **Ensure All Columns are Selected:**\n   - Select all columns from 'ss_ztf' (using SELECT *), and the specified detection columns: detection date ('mjd'), filter ('fid'), 'isdiffpos', RA, Dec, difference magnitude ('magpsf'), and its error ('sigmapsf').\n\n9. **Optimize the Query:**\n   - Use indexes on 'ra' and 'dec' columns in 'detection' for efficient spatial querying.\n   - Use the 'q3c_radial_query' function with the correct radius in degrees (2 arcseconds = 2/3600 degrees).\n\n10. **Final Sorting:**\n    - Apply ORDER BY on 'ssnamenr' and 'mjd' to meet the sorting criteria.\n\nThis systematic approach ensures that the query accurately finds all relevant detections near the specified SSOs, retrieves the necessary information, and sorts the results as requested.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

If you want to add comments, use the SQL comment format inside the query.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nTo generate a PostgreSQL query that retrieves all detections for ZTF objects within 2 arcseconds of the specified Solar System identifiers '2003FP134' and '2009UK56', and returns the specified columns sorted by MPC name and detection date, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Solar System Objects (SSOs):**\n   - Use the 'ss_ztf' table to find the entries where 'ssnamenr' matches '2003FP134' and '2009UK56'.\n   - Retrieve their 'oid' values, which uniquely identify these SSOs.\n\n2. **Obtain the Coordinates of the Target SSOs:**\n   - For each identified SSO, extract the 'candid' (candidate ID), 'ssdistnr' (distance to nearest known solar system object), 'ssmagnr' (magnitude), and 'ssnamenr' (name).\n   - Use the 'candid' or 'oid' to get the precise celestial coordinates (RA and Dec) associated with each SSO, if available, or directly from the 'ss_ztf' table if it contains coordinate info. If the table does not contain RA/Dec, consider that the 'ssdistnr' is the angular separation to the closest known object, but for spatial filtering, actual RA/Dec coordinates are needed.\n\n3. **Define a Spatial Filter Using Q3C Functions:**\n   - For each SSO, use the 'q3c_dist' function to find all 'detection' entries where the angular distance between the detection's RA/Dec and the SSO's RA/Dec is less than or equal to 2 arcseconds (which is 2/3600 degrees).\n   - This involves creating a spatial condition that compares each detection's coordinates with each SSO's coordinates.\n\n4. **Retrieve Detections Near the SSOs:**\n   - Query the 'detection' table for entries where the detection's 'oid' matches objects associated with the filtered detections.\n   - For each detection, extract the following columns:\n     - Detection date ('mjd')\n     - Filter identifier ('fid')\n     - 'isdiffpos' flag\n     - RA ('ra') and Dec ('dec') coordinates\n     - Difference magnitude ('magpsf') and its uncertainty ('sigmapsf')\n\n5. **Join the Data:**\n   - Join the 'detection' table with the 'ss_ztf' table based on the spatial proximity condition.\n   - Ensure that the join is performed for each SSO's coordinates, so detections within 2 arcseconds of either SSO are included.\n\n6. **Sort the Results:**\n   - Order the final results by the MPC name ('ssnamenr') from 'ss_ztf' and then by detection date ('mjd').\n\n7. **Select the Columns:**\n   - From the 'ss_ztf' table, select all columns.\n   - From the 'detection' table, select 'mjd', 'fid', 'isdiffpos', 'ra', 'dec', 'magpsf', and 'sigmapsf'.\n\n8. **Handle Multiple SSOs:**\n   - Repeat the spatial filtering for both SSOs and combine the results, ensuring no duplicates if detections are within 2 arcseconds of both.\n\n9. **Final Sorting:**\n   - Apply sorting by 'ssnamenr' and 'mjd' as specified.\n\nThis systematic approach ensures that the query accurately finds all relevant detections near the specified SSOs, using spatial filtering with the Q3C extension for efficiency, and returns the requested columns sorted appropriately.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''For Solar System identifiers '2003FP134' and '2009UK56', get all detections for all ZTF objects that lie within 2 arcsec from any of them.

If you want to add comments, use the SQL comment format inside the query.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nTo decompose the user request into a systematic plan for generating the PostgreSQL query, follow these detailed steps:\n\n1. **Identify the target object:**\n   - Use the object identifier `'ZTF24aamtvxb'` to filter data related to this specific object.\n   - This involves referencing the `object` table to obtain the `oid` associated with `'ZTF24aamtvxb'`.\n\n2. **Retrieve the object\u2019s unique identifier:**\n   - Query the `object` table to find the `oid` corresponding to `'ZTF24aamtvxb'`.\n   - Store this `oid` for subsequent filtering in the detection, non-detection, and forced photometry tables.\n\n3. **Gather detection data:**\n   - Filter the `detection` table for entries where `oid` matches the obtained object `oid`.\n   - Select relevant columns: `candid` (ZTF identifier), `mjd` (epoch date), `fid` (filter identifier), `isdiffpos` (isdiffpos flag), `magpsf` (detection difference magnitude), `sigmapsf` (uncertainty of detection difference magnitude), `maglim` (5-sigma magnitude limit).\n   - Assign a constant value `'detection'` to the `table` column for these rows.\n\n4. **Gather non-detection data:**\n   - Filter the `non_detection` table for entries where `oid` matches the object `oid`.\n   - Select relevant columns: `fid`, `mjd`, `diffmaglim`.\n   - Since non-detections do not have difference magnitudes or uncertainties, set these columns to `NULL`.\n   - Assign `'non_detection'` to the `table` column for these rows.\n\n5. **Gather forced photometry data:**\n   - Filter the `forced_photometry` table for entries where `oid` matches the object `oid`.\n   - Select relevant columns: `mjd`, `fid`, `mag`, `e_mag`.\n   - For the `candid` column, use the `pid` as the ZTF identifier.\n   - Set the `isdiffpos` flag to `NULL` as it is not applicable.\n   - Assign `'forced_photometry'` to the `table` column for these rows.\n\n6. **Combine all data into a single output:**\n   - Use a `UNION ALL` operation to merge the detection, non-detection, and forced photometry datasets.\n   - Ensure all selected columns are aligned in order and data types are compatible.\n   - The final output should include columns: ZTF identifier (`candid` or `pid`), epoch date (`mjd`), filter identifier (`fid`), `isdiffpos` flag, detection difference magnitude (`magpsf`), its uncertainty (`sigmapsf`), 5-sigma magnitude limit (`maglim`), forced difference magnitude (`mag`), its uncertainty (`e_mag`), and the `table` name.\n\n7. **Order and present the results:**\n   - Optionally, order the combined results by epoch date (`mjd`) for chronological clarity.\n   - Return the complete dataset with all epochs, regardless of the table of origin, in a single table format.\n\n8. **Additional considerations:**\n   - Confirm that the `object` table contains the object identifier `'ZTF24aamtvxb'`.\n   - Handle cases where no data exists in one or more tables for this object.\n   - Use exact table and column names as specified, ensuring no syntax errors.\n\nThis systematic approach ensures that all relevant data points from detections, non-detections, and forced photometry are retrieved, labeled by their source table, and combined into a comprehensive output for the specified object.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

Difference between last and first detection times (lastmjd - firstmjd) > 20 days.\n\n3. **Access the relevant data for each condition:**\n   - The 'object' table contains the 'ndet', 'firstmjd', and 'lastmjd' columns directly, which are needed for conditions (a) and (c).\n   - The 'magstat' table contains magnitude statistics, including 'fid' (filter ID), 'magmin_corr', 'magmax_corr', 'firstmjd', and 'lastmjd' for each object.\n   - Since the user specifies the difference between g- and r-band corrected magnitudes, identify the 'fid' values for g-band and r-band (commonly 1 for g, 2 for r).\n\n4. **Join the 'object' table with the 'magstat' table:**\n   - Perform an INNER JOIN between 'object' and 'magstat' on the 'oid' column to access magnitude statistics.\n   - Filter the 'magstat' entries to include only those with 'fid' = 1 (g-band) and 'fid' = 2 (r-band).\n\n5. **Calculate the magnitude difference:**\n   - For each object, compute the difference between the minimum g-band corrected magnitude ('magmin_corr' where 'fid' = 1) and the minimum r-band corrected magnitude ('magmin_corr' where 'fid' = 2).\n   - Filter objects where this difference exceeds 3.5.\n\n6. **Calculate the time difference between last and first detection:**\n   - Use 'lastmjd' and 'firstmjd' columns from the 'object' table.\n   - Filter objects where ('lastmjd' - 'firstmjd') > 20.\n\n7. **Apply the detection count condition:**\n   - Filter objects where 'ndet' \u2265 30.\n\n8. **Limit the number of results:**\n   - Restrict the output to at most 20 objects using a LIMIT clause.\n\n9. **Select all columns from the 'object' table:**\n   - Ensure the final SELECT statement retrieves all columns from 'object' for the filtered objects.\n\n10. **Order the results (optional):**\n    - If desired, order the results by a relevant column such as 'lastmjd' or 'ndet' for consistency, but this is optional based on user request.\n\n11. **Ensure query efficiency:**\n    - Use appropriate indexes on 'oid', 'ndet', 'firstmjd', 'lastmjd', and 'magstat' columns to optimize joins and filters.\n    - Use subqueries or CTEs if necessary to simplify magnitude comparisons.\n\nBy following these steps, the query will accurately filter objects based on detection counts, magnitude differences, and time span, returning all columns from the 'object' table for up to 20 qualifying objects.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

If no specific order is requested, the default can be arbitrary.\n\n6. **Ensure the query is efficient:**\n   - Use existing indexes on relevant columns ('ndet', 'g_r_max_corr', 'g_r_mean_corr', 'firstmjd', 'lastmjd') to optimize filtering performance.\n\n7. **Construct the final query structure:**\n   - Select all columns from the 'object' table.\n   - Apply the WHERE clause with all three conditions.\n   - Limit the output to 20 objects.\n\n8. **Optional: Validate the logic:**\n   - Confirm that the magnitude difference calculation uses the correct columns and units.\n   - Ensure that the date difference is in days, matching the 'mjd' units.\n\nBy following these steps, the query will accurately retrieve up to 20 ZTF objects that meet the specified detection count, magnitude difference, and time span criteria, returning all relevant columns from the 'object' table.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

Create a sub-query using the 'probability' TABLE filtering the desired objects.\nII. For each feature, you have to make a sub-query retrieving the specific feature adding the condition of its value, taking only the oids in the 'probability' sub-query with an INNER JOIN inside each 'feature' sub-query to retrieve only the features associated with the desired spatial objects.\nIII. Make an UNION between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nIV. Make an INTERSECT between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nV. Filter the 'UNION' query from step III selecting only the 'oids' that are in the 'INTERSECT' query from step IV\nVI. Add the remaining conditions to the final result of step V, using the 'probability' sub-query from step I.\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nDecomposition plan for generating the PostgreSQL query:\n\n1. **Identify the main tables and columns involved:**\n   - The primary table for object identifiers and coordinates is the `object` table, which contains `oid`, `meanra`, and `meandec`.\n   - The `detection` table provides information on candidate identifiers (`candid`), filter IDs (`fid`), magnitudes (`magpsf`), magnitude errors (`sigmapsf`), and detection magnitudes (`magpsf_corr`), as well as the corrected difference magnitude (`magpsf_corr`) in the r-band.\n   - The `probability` table contains classification probabilities, including the class name, classifier name, and ranking, linked via `oid`.\n   - The `light curve classifier` (specifically `lc_classifier_stochastic`) provides class probabilities, which need to be filtered for the class 'CV/Nova' with the highest probability (ranking=1).\n\n2. **Filter objects based on classification:**\n   - Use the `probability` table to select objects (`oid`) where:\n     - `classifier_name='lc_classifier_stochastic'`\n     - `class_name='CV/Nova'`\n     - `ranking=1` (highest probability class)\n   - This sub-query isolates objects classified as CV/Nova with the highest confidence.\n\n3. **Filter objects based on detection count:**\n   - For each object (`oid`), count the number of detections in the `detection` table.\n   - Filter objects with `ndet` (total detections) less than or equal to 50.\n   - Ensure the detection count is calculated from the discovery date (`firstmjd`) to the last detection (`lastmjd`) or from the detection timestamps (`mjd` in `detection` table).\n\n4. **Retrieve detection details:**\n   - For the filtered objects, select detection entries with:\n     - Filter ID (`fid`) corresponding to the r-band (assumed to be `fid=2`).\n     - Corrected difference magnitude (`magpsf_corr`) in the r-band.\n     - PSF-corrected magnitude (`magpsf`) in the r-band.\n     - Magnitude errors (`sigmapsf`) and (`sigmapsf_corr`).\n   - Calculate the maximum rise for each object by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum `magpsf_corr` across detections.\n\n5. **Coordinate retrieval:**\n   - From the `object` table, get the mean right ascension (`meanra`) and declination (`meandec`) for each object.\n\n6. **Combine the data:**\n   - Join the filtered objects with their detection data, ensuring only detections in the r-band with corrected difference magnitudes are included.\n   - For each object, compute the maximum rise from the minimum detection magnitude.\n\n7. **Select required columns:**\n   - Object identifier (`oid`)\n   - Candidate identifier (`candid`)\n   - Filter ID as `'f_id'` (fixed value or derived from `fid`)\n   - Coordinates (`meanra`, `meandec`)\n   - Magnitude (`magpsf_corr`)\n   - Magnitude error (`sigmapsf_corr`)\n   - Maximum rise (computed value)\n\n8. **Order and limit the results:**\n   - Order the final result set by object identifier (`oid`).\n   - Limit the output to the first 1000 rows.\n\n9. **Additional filtering and conditions:**\n   - Ensure the object is classified as CV/Nova with the highest probability in the stochastic classifier.\n   - Confirm the detection count constraint (`ndet <= 50`) is applied correctly.\n   - Filter detections to only include those in the r-band (`fid=2`).\n   - Use `LIMIT 1000` and `ORDER BY oid` to finalize the output.\n\n10. **Ensure performance and correctness:**\n    - Use appropriate JOINs (INNER JOIN) between `object`, `probability`, and `detection`.\n    - Use sub-queries or CTEs to handle classification filtering and detection count calculations efficiently.\n    - Verify that the selection of maximum rise is correctly computed per object across detections.\n\nThis systematic decomposition ensures the query accurately retrieves the specified columns, applies the necessary filters, and computes the maximum rise, all ordered and limited as requested.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Get the columns that contains: object identifier, candidate identifier, filter id as 'f_id', co-ordinates, magnitude, magnitude errors.
