Select objects where the highest probability in the `stamp_classifier` is for class `'SN'`.\n   - Use the `probability` table filtered by `classifier_name='stamp_classifier'` and `ranking=1` (most probable class).\n   - Ensure the class with the highest probability is `'SN'` by filtering for `class_name='SN'` and the maximum probability per object.\n\n3. **Identify objects with their maximum probability in the stamp classifier:**\n   - For each object, find the maximum probability value in the `probability` table where `classifier_name='stamp_classifier'` and `ranking=1`.\n   - Filter objects where this maximum probability is associated with class `'SN'`.\n\n4. **Filter objects with their first detection within the first 2 days of September:**\n   - Use the `object` table's `firstmjd` column.\n   - Select objects where `firstmjd` is between 60188.0 and 60190.0 (inclusive).\n\n5. **Determine objects that qualify as fast risers:**\n   - For each object, analyze the `detection` table:\n     - Find the first detection (minimum `mjd`) for that object.\n     - Find the last non-detection before the first detection:\n       - Identify the detection immediately preceding the first detection (by `mjd`).\n       - Check the `isdiffpos` value for the last non-detection (where `isdiffpos=0` or as per data convention).\n     - Calculate the rate of initial brightness change:\n       - Compute the difference in magnitude (`magpsf`) between the first detection and the last non-detection.\n       - Compute the time difference in days between these two events.\n       - Determine if the rate of change is at least 0.25 magnitudes/day.\n     - Confirm the object qualifies as a fast riser if the rate condition is met.\n\n6. **Retrieve non-detections for the qualifying objects:**\n   - From the `detection` table, select entries where `oid` matches the qualifying objects.\n   - Filter for non-detections (`isdiffpos=0`).\n   - For each, retrieve:\n     - `candid` (candidate ID)\n     - `magpsf` (difference magnitude)\n     - `fid` (filter ID)\n     - `diffmaglim` (difference magnitude limit)\n     - The `magstat` table for each object and filter:\n       - Join on `oid` and `fid`.\n       - Retrieve `magstat` fields, including `magstat_fid` (filter ID in `magstat`) and the initial rise estimate (which can be derived from the magnitude change over time).\n\n7. **Calculate the initial rise estimate:**\n   - For each object, estimate the initial rise as the difference in magnitude divided by the time difference (in days) between the last non-detection and the first detection.\n   - This provides the rate of brightness increase, which should be at least 0.25 mag/day for fast risers.\n\n8. **Order and limit the results:**\n   - Order the final result set by `oid`.\n   - Limit the output to 100 rows.\n\n9. **Construct the final query structure:**\n   - Use subqueries or Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to:\n     - Filter objects based on class and first detection date.\n     - Identify fast risers based on the magnitude change rate.\n     - Join with `detection` for non-detections.\n     - Join with `magstat` for additional magnitude info.\n   - Select the required columns:\n     - `oid`\n     - Maximum probability in the stamp classifier\n     - For each non-detection: `candid`, `magpsf`, `fid`, `diffmaglim`\n     - The `magstat_fid` (filter ID from `magstat`)\n     - The initial rise estimate (computed as magnitude change over time)\n\n10. **Ensure all filters and conditions are applied:**\n    - Use the `probability` table with `ranking=1` and `classifier_name='stamp_classifier'`.\n    - Confirm the class is `'SN'`.\n    - Confirm the first detection date is within the specified range.\n    - Confirm the brightness increase rate exceeds 0.25 mag/day.\n    - Limit the results to 100 entries ordered by `oid`.\n\nThis detailed decomposition ensures that the final SQL query will accurately retrieve the objects matching all specified criteria, including class, detection timing, and rapid brightness increase, along with relevant non-detection data and magnitude statistics.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4393, "completion_tokens": 1085, "total_tokens": 5478, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 2816, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_f12167b370"}}, "error": null}
