Use the `probability` table to filter objects classified by the `stamp_classifier` with the highest probability (ranking=1) for class `'SN'`.\n     - Columns needed: `oid`, `probability`, `class_name`, `classifier_name`, `ranking`.\n   - Use the `object` table to get the object identifiers (`oid`) and the time of first detection (`firstmjd`).\n   - Use the `detection` table to retrieve the light curve detections for the objects, including `oid`, `candid`, `fid` (filter ID), and other detection details.\n   - Use the `magstat` table to get the filter ID (`fid`) as `magstat_fid` and the initial rise estimate, which corresponds to the feature `dmag_first` for the relevant filter.\n     - Note: The initial rise estimate is defined as the difference in magnitude between the last non-detection and the first detection in the same filter, which corresponds to the `dmag_first` column in `magstat`.\n\n2. **Apply Classification Filter:**\n   - Filter the `probability` table for:\n     - `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`\n     - `class_name = 'SN'`\n     - `ranking = 1` (to get the highest probability class only)\n   - This will yield the list of object IDs (`oid`) classified as SN with the highest probability by the stamp classifier.\n\n3. **Filter Objects by First Detection Date:**\n   - Join the filtered `probability` results with the `object` table on `oid`.\n   - Filter objects whose `firstmjd` is between 60188.0 and 60189.0 inclusive, corresponding to the first two days of September.\n\n4. **Identify Fast Risers:**\n   - The fast riser condition requires that the initial rise rate is at least 0.25 magnitudes/day.\n   - The initial rise rate can be calculated as the difference in magnitude between the last non-detection and the first detection divided by the time difference between these two events.\n   - The `magstat` table contains `dmag_first` (difference in magnitude at first detection) and `dt_first` (time difference between last non-detection and first detection) for each filter.\n   - Join the `magstat` table on `oid` to get these values.\n   - Filter for `dmag_first / dt_first >= 0.25` to select fast risers.\n   - Also, ensure that the `magstat` entries correspond to the same filter as the first detection filter in the `detection` table (or at least consistent with the filter used for the initial rise estimate).\n   - Since the user wants the filter ID from `magstat` as `magstat_fid`, include `magstat.fid` in the output.\n\n5. **Retrieve Light Curve Detections:**\n   - Join the `detection` table on `oid` to get all detections for the selected objects.\n   - Include columns: `oid`, `candid`, `fid` (filter ID).\n   - Only include detections (all rows in `detection` correspond to detections).\n   - No additional filtering on detections is specified, so include all detections for the selected objects.\n\n6. **Retrieve Probabilities from Stamp Classifier:**\n   - For each selected object, retrieve the probability value from the `probability` table for the `stamp_classifier` and class `'SN'` (already filtered in step 2).\n   - Include the `probability` column in the output.\n\n7. **Select and Alias Columns:**\n   - Select the following columns in the final output:\n     - `oid` (object identifier)\n     - `probability` (from `probability` table for `stamp_classifier` and class `'SN'`)\n     - `candid` (from `detection` table)\n     - `fid` (filter ID from `detection` table)\n     - `magstat_fid` (alias for `magstat.fid`)\n     - `dmag_first` (initial rise estimate from `magstat`)\n\n8. **Join Strategy:**\n   - Start from the filtered `probability` table (step 2).\n   - Join with `object` to filter by `firstmjd` (step 3).\n   - Join with `magstat` to get initial rise parameters and filter by fast riser condition (step 4).\n   - Join with `detection` to get light curve detections (step 5).\n   - Ensure joins are on `oid`.\n   - Use INNER JOINs to ensure only objects meeting all criteria are included.\n\n9. **Ordering:**\n   - Order the final results by `oid` ascending.\n\n10. **Additional Considerations:**\n    - Ensure that the `magstat` entries used correspond to the same filter as the first detection filter or at least are consistent with the initial rise estimate definition.\n    - If multiple filters exist for an object in `magstat`, consider selecting the filter corresponding to the first detection filter or the filter with the maximum initial rise rate.\n    - If the user does not specify, include all detections regardless of filter.\n    - Use the exact column and table names as specified.\n    - Apply the default condition for `probability` table: `ranking=1` and `classifier_name='stamp_classifier'` for the classification filter.\n    - The user wants the probability from the stamp classifier, so do not include probabilities from other classifiers.\n\nBy following these steps, the resulting query will retrieve the object identifiers, their highest probability for class `'SN'` from the stamp classifier, all detections (with candid and filter ID), the filter ID from `magstat` as `magstat_fid`, and the initial rise estimate (`dmag_first`), for objects first detected in the first two days of September and qualifying as fast risers, ordered by `oid`.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 6538, "completion_tokens": 1266, "total_tokens": 7804, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5"}}, "error": null}

Join the filtered `probability` table (step 2) with the `object` table (step 3) on `oid`.\n   - Join the result with the `magstat` table (step 4) on `oid` to get the filter ID and initial rise estimate.\n   -

Since the user requests it alongside `name` and `version`, it is likely the `probability` column from the `probability` table.\n     - The \"source identifier\" is ambiguous but likely corresponds to the `step_id` or `classifier_version` from the `probability` table or the `step` table. Since the user wants `name` and `version` from the `step` table, the source identifier can be the `step_id` or `classifier_version` linked to the classification.\n   - The `object` table does not have `sgscore1` column mentioned in the schema. This suggests `sgscore1` is either a user-defined column or from another table not listed. Since it is required, assume it is a column in the `object` table or a related table. If it is in another table, identify and join accordingly. If not available, clarify or omit.\n   - The user wants the distance from the center of Abell 370 calculated using the `q3c_dist` function.\n\n2. **Apply Time Filter for First Detection in July 2023:**\n   - Use the `firstmjd` column in the `object` table.\n   - Filter objects where `firstmjd` is between 60126.0 and 60156.0 (start and end of July 2023).\n\n3. **Apply Spatial Filter Using Q3C:**\n   - The center coordinates of Abell 370 are RA=39.97, Dec=-1.5768.\n   - The search radius is 1000 arcmin, which equals 16.16667 degrees.\n   - Use the `q3c_radial_query` function to filter objects within this radius based on their `meanra` and `meandec`.\n   - Also calculate the distance using `q3c_dist(meanra, meandec, 39.97, -1.5768)` and return it as `dist`.\n\n4. **Filter Based on `sgscore1` < 0.3:**\n   - Since `sgscore1` is not in the provided schema, verify its location.\n   - If it is in the `object` table, apply the filter directly.\n   - If it is in another table, join that table accordingly.\n   - If unavailable, note this as a limitation or clarify.\n\n5. **Filter Based on Stamp Classifier Probabilities:**\n   - Use the `probability` table.\n   - Filter for `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`.\n   - Only consider the highest probability class per object (`ranking = 1`).\n   - Exclude objects where the highest probability class is 'asteroid' or 'bogus'.\n   - Join the `probability` table with the `object` table on `oid`.\n\n6. **Retrieve Required Columns:**\n   - From `object`: `oid`, `meanra`, `meandec`.\n   - From `probability`: `probability` as `value`, `class_name` (if needed), `classifier_version` as `version`.\n   - From `step`: `name` and `version` corresponding to the `classifier_version` or `step_id` linked to the classification.\n     - Join `step` table on `step_id` = `classifier_version` or another appropriate key.\n   - Include the calculated distance as `dist`.\n\n7. **Construct Joins:**\n   - Inner join `object` and `probability` on `oid`.\n   - Inner join `probability` and `step` on `classifier_version` = `step_id` (assuming this relation).\n   - If `sgscore1` is in another table, join that table accordingly.\n\n8. **Apply Default Conditions:**\n   - For the `probability` table, always filter by `ranking = 1` and `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'` as per user request.\n   - Apply all other filters as described.\n\n9. **Ordering and Output:**\n   - The user does not specify ordering; default ordering can be by distance ascending or by `oid`.\n   - Select the columns as requested: `oid`, `value` (probability), `name` (from step), `version` (from step), `meanra`, `meandec`, source identifier (likely `classifier_version` or `step_id`), and `dist`.\n\n10. **Summary of Steps:**\n    - Filter `object` by `firstmjd` in July 2023.\n    - Filter `object` by spatial location within 16.16667 degrees of (39.97, -1.5768) using `q3c_radial_query`.\n    - Filter `object` by `sgscore1 < 0.3`.\n    - Join with `probability` filtered by `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'` and `ranking = 1`.\n    - Exclude objects with `class_name` in ('asteroid', 'bogus').\n    - Join with `step` table to get `name` and `version`.\n    - Calculate distance using `q3c_dist`.\n    - Select requested columns.\n\nThis decomposition plan ensures the query will retrieve the object identifiers and associated metadata for objects first detected in July 2023, within the specified spatial radius, with low `sgscore1`, and whose top stamp classifier probability is not 'asteroid' or 'bogus', including the requested columns and the distance from the Abell 370 center.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2906, "completion_tokens": 1312, "total_tokens": 4218, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5"}}, "error": null}

Since the user requests \"value\" and \"source identifier,\" and these are not columns in `object` or `probability`, it is necessary to clarify or interpret:\n       - Possibly \"value\" refers to the probability value from the `probability` table.\n       - \"source identifier\" could be the `oid` or another identifier; since no other source identifier is defined, assume it is `oid`.\n   - The `stamp_classifier` classification probabilities are stored in the `probability` table with `classifier_name='stamp_classifier'`.\n   - The `sgscore1` column is not explicitly listed in the schema provided. It is likely a column in the `object` table or another table not listed. Since it is not in the schema, assume it is in the `object` table or a related table. If it is in another table, a join will be needed. For this plan, assume it is in the `object` table.\n\n2. **Apply Time Filter for First Detection in July 2023:**\n   - Use the `firstmjd` column in the `object` table.\n   - Filter objects where `firstmjd` is between 60126.0 and 60156.0 (start and end of July 2023).\n\n3. **Apply Spatial Filter Using Q3C:**\n   - Use the `q3c_radial_query` function to filter objects within a radius of 16.16667 degrees (1000 arcmin) from the center of Abell 370 (RA=39.97, Dec=-1.5768).\n   - The function will be applied on `meanra` and `meandec` columns of the `object` table.\n\n4. **Apply sgscore1 Filter:**\n   - Filter objects with `sgscore1 < 0.3`.\n   - Since `sgscore1` is not explicitly in the schema, confirm its table and join if necessary. If it is in the `object` table, apply the filter directly.\n\n5. **Filter Based on Stamp Classifier Probabilities:**\n   - Join the `probability` table on `oid` to get the classification probabilities for each object.\n   - Filter for `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`.\n   - Restrict to the highest probability class per object by filtering `ranking = 1`.\n   - Exclude objects where the highest probability class is 'asteroid' or 'bogus'.\n   - Retrieve the `value` column as the probability value from the `probability` table.\n\n6. **Retrieve Step Information:**\n   - Join the `step` table to get the `name` and `version` columns.\n   - The join key is likely `step_id` in the `object` table or `probability` table. Since `step_id_corr` is in the `object` table, and the user requests `name` and `version`, join `step` on `object.step_id_corr = step.step_id`.\n   - This will provide the pipeline step name and version related to the object.\n\n7. **Calculate Distance Using q3c_dist:**\n   - Use the `q3c_dist` function to calculate the angular distance between each object's `meanra`, `meandec` and the Abell 370 center (RA=39.97, Dec=-1.5768).\n   - Return this value as `dist`.\n\n8. **Select Required Columns:**\n   - Select the following columns in the output:\n     - `oid` from `object`\n     - `value` from `probability` (probability value of the highest ranked class in the stamp classifier)\n     - `name` and `version` from `step`\n     - `meanra` and `meandec` from `object`\n     - The source identifier (assumed to be `oid` again, or clarify if different)\n     - The calculated distance as `dist`\n\n9. **Construct the Query with Appropriate Joins and Filters:**\n   - Start from the `object` table.\n   - Join `probability` on `oid` with conditions `classifier_name='stamp_classifier'` and `ranking=1`.\n   - Join `step` on `object.step_id_corr = step.step_id`.\n   - Apply all filters: `firstmjd` date range, spatial radius, `sgscore1 < 0.3`, and exclude classes 'asteroid' and 'bogus' in the highest probability stamp classifier.\n   - Calculate distance using `q3c_dist`.\n\n10. **Ordering and Final Output:**\n    - The user does not specify ordering; default ordering can be by distance ascending or by `oid`.\n    - Ensure the query returns only distinct objects if duplicates are possible.\n\n11. **Additional Considerations:**\n    - Confirm the exact table and column for `sgscore1`. If it is in another table, include the necessary join.\n    - Confirm the meaning of \"source identifier\" if different from `oid`.\n    - Use exact column and table names as per the schema.\n    - Use the default conditions for the `probability` table as specified (ranking=1 and classifier_name='stamp_classifier' in this case).\n    - Use the Q3C extension functions correctly with the right parameter order.\n\nBy following these steps, the resulting query will accurately retrieve the requested object identifiers and associated information filtered by date, spatial location, classification, and other criteria.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2906, "completion_tokens": 1316, "total_tokens": 4222, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5"}}, "error": null}

From the user request, the main entities are:\n     - Objects classified as SN II with probability > 0.6.\n     - Detections of those objects.\n     - Features of those objects.\n   - Relevant tables and columns:\n     - `probability`: to filter objects classified as 'SNII' with probability > 0.6, classifier_name='lc_classifier', and ranking=1.\n       - Columns: `oid`, `class_name`, `probability`, `ranking`, `classifier_name`.\n     - `object`: to filter objects with number of detections (`ndet`) > 50.\n       - Columns: `oid`, `ndet`.\n     - `magstat`: to filter objects with difference between minimum and maximum magnitudes in ZTF g-band (fid=1) greater than 2 mag.\n       - Columns: `oid`, `fid`, `magmax`, `magmin`.\n     - `feature`: to retrieve feature name, value, and feature fid (renamed as `feature_fid`).\n       - Columns: `oid`, `name`, `value`, `fid`.\n     - `detection`: to retrieve candidate identifier (`candid`), psf magnitudes (`magpsf`), magnitude errors (`sigmapsf`), and band identifiers (`fid`).\n       - Columns: `oid`, `candid`, `magpsf`, `sigmapsf`, `fid`, `mjd` (time of detection).\n\n2. **Step 1: Filter Objects Classified as SN II with Probability > 0.6**\n   - Query the `probability` table with conditions:\n     - `class_name = 'SNII'`\n     - `probability > 0.6`\n     - `ranking = 1` (to get the most likely class)\n     - `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`\n   - This will produce a list of `oid`s of objects classified as SN II with high confidence.\n\n3. **Step 2: Filter Objects with Number of Detections > 50**\n   - Join the filtered `oid`s from Step 1 with the `object` table.\n   - Apply the condition `ndet > 50` on the `object` table.\n   - This step narrows down the objects to those with sufficient detections.\n\n4. **Step 3: Filter Objects with Magnitude Difference in g-band > 2 mag**\n   - Join the filtered `oid`s from Step 2 with the `magstat` table.\n   - Filter `magstat` rows where `fid = 1` (g-band).\n   - Calculate the difference between `magmax` and `magmin` and filter where this difference is greater than 2.\n   - This step ensures the objects have significant variability in the g-band.\n\n5. **Step 4: Retrieve Features for the Filtered Objects**\n   - Since the user requests the feature name, value, and feature fid (renamed as `feature_fid`), query the `feature` table.\n   - Join the `feature` table with the filtered `oid`s from Step 3.\n   - Select columns: `oid`, `name`, `value`, and `fid` (renamed as `feature_fid`).\n   - No specific feature filtering is requested, so retrieve all features for these objects.\n\n6. **Step 5: Retrieve Detections for the Filtered Objects**\n   - Query the `detection` table for the filtered `oid`s from Step 3.\n   - Select columns: `oid`, `candid` (candidate identifier), `magpsf` (psf magnitude), `sigmapsf` (magnitude error), `fid` (band identifier), and `mjd` (time of detection).\n   - This will provide the time series data for the detections.\n\n7. **Step 6: Combine Features and Detections**\n   - The user wants the output as a function of time, implying that detection time (`mjd`) is important.\n   - Since features are static per object and detections are time-dependent, the query should join the `feature` and `detection` tables on `oid`.\n   - This join will produce rows with:\n     - `oid`\n     - `candid`\n     - `feature` name, value, and `feature_fid`\n     - `magpsf`, `sigmapsf`, `fid` (from detection)\n     - `mjd` (time of detection)\n   - This join will produce multiple rows per object per detection per feature.\n\n8. **Step 7: Final Selection and Ordering**\n   - Select the columns as requested:\n     - `oid` (object identifier)\n     - `candid` (candidate identifier)\n     - `feature` name\n     - `feature` value\n     - `magpsf` (psf magnitude)\n     - `sigmapsf` (magnitude error)\n     - `fid` from `feature` table renamed as `feature_fid`\n     - `mjd` (time of detection)\n   - Order the results by `oid` ascending.\n\n9. **Step 8: Optimize the Query**\n   - Use INNER JOINs to ensure only objects meeting all criteria are included.\n   - Use subqueries or CTEs (WITH clauses) to filter objects stepwise:\n     - First filter by classification and probability.\n     - Then filter by number of detections.\n     - Then filter by magnitude difference in g-band.\n   - Join the filtered object list with `feature` and `detection` tables.\n   - Apply the renaming of the `fid` column from the `feature` table as `feature_fid` in the SELECT clause.\n\n10. **Summary of the Query Logic:**\n    - Start with a subquery filtering `probability` for SNII with probability > 0.6, ranking=1, classifier_name='lc_classifier'.\n    - Join with `object` to filter `ndet > 50`.\n    - Join with `magstat` filtered on `fid=1` and `(magmax - magmin) > 2`.\n    - Use the resulting `oid`s to join with `feature` and `detection`.\n    - Select the requested columns, rename `feature.fid` as `feature_fid`.\n    - Order by `oid`.\n\nThis decomposition plan ensures the query is accurate, efficient, and meets all user requirements.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 6732, "completion_tokens": 1370, "total_tokens": 8102, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5"}}, "error": null}

The main object information is in the `object` table.\n   - Classification probabilities are in the `probability` table.\n   - Light curve data (detections) are in the `detection` table.\n   - Initial rise rate and observation duration per band are in the `magstat` table.\n   \n   Columns needed:\n   - From `object`: `oid` (object identifier).\n   - From `detection`: `candid` (candidate identifier), `magpsf` (magnitude), `sigmapsf` (magnitude error), `fid` (band identifier, to be renamed as `f_id`), `mjd` (time).\n   - From `probability`: `class_name`, `probability`, `ranking`, `classifier_name`.\n   - From `magstat`: `fid`, `dmdt_first` (initial rise rate), `ndet` (number of detections), `firstmjd`, `lastmjd` (to calculate observation duration).\n\n2. **Apply Classification and Probability Filters:**\n   - Filter `probability` table for:\n     - `class_name = 'SNII'` (Supernova Type II).\n     - `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'` (default classifier).\n     - `ranking = 1` (most likely class).\n     - `probability > 0.6`.\n   - This will give the set of object IDs (`oid`) classified as SNII with high confidence.\n\n3. **Filter Objects by Observation Time Range:**\n   - Use the `object` table to ensure the objects have detections within the time range corresponding to years 2019-2022.\n   - The Modified Julian Date (MJD) range is from 58484.0 (start of 2019) to 59944.0 (end of 2022).\n   - Filter objects where `firstmjd` and `lastmjd` overlap with this range, or more conservatively, where `firstmjd <= 59944.0` and `lastmjd >= 58484.0`.\n   - Join with the filtered `probability` results on `oid`.\n\n4. **Filter by Initial Rise Rate and Number of Detections in g and r Bands:**\n   - Use the `magstat` table to filter objects with:\n     - `fid` in (1, 2) corresponding to g and r bands.\n     - `dmdt_first > 0.5` mag/day (initial rise rate).\n     - `ndet > 30` (number of detections).\n     - Observation duration in r-band (`fid=2`) of at least 100 days, calculated as `lastmjd - firstmjd >= 100`.\n   - Since the initial rise rate and number of detections are band-specific, ensure these conditions are met for both g and r bands.\n   - This requires joining or intersecting the `magstat` entries for the same `oid` for both bands.\n   - To do this:\n     - Create two subqueries from `magstat` filtered by `fid=1` and `fid=2` respectively, applying the conditions on `dmdt_first` and `ndet`.\n     - For the r-band (`fid=2`), also apply the observation duration condition.\n     - Intersect the sets of `oid` from both subqueries to ensure the object meets criteria in both bands.\n\n5. **Combine Filters on Objects:**\n   - Join the filtered `probability` results (step 2) with the filtered `object` results (step 3).\n   - Join the result with the filtered `magstat` results (step 4) to ensure all conditions are met.\n   - This will yield the final list of `oid` that satisfy classification, probability, time range, initial rise rate, number of detections, and observation duration criteria.\n\n6. **Retrieve Detection Data for Selected Objects:**\n   - From the `detection` table, select:\n     - `oid` (object identifier).\n     - `candid` (candidate identifier).\n     - `magpsf` (magnitude).\n     - `sigmapsf` (magnitude error).\n     - `fid` (band identifier), rename as `f_id`.\n     - `mjd` (time of detection).\n   - Filter detections to include only those with `oid` in the final filtered set from step 5.\n   - Optionally, filter detections to the time range 2019-2022 (`mjd` between 58484.0 and 59944.0) to match the user\u2019s request.\n\n7. **Final Output:**\n   - Select the columns as specified: object identifier (`oid`), candidate identifier (`candid`), magnitudes (`magpsf`), magnitude errors (`sigmapsf`), band identifiers renamed as `f_id`, and time (`mjd`).\n   - Order the results by `oid` and `mjd` to present the light curve data in chronological order per object.\n\n8. **Summary of Query Structure:**\n   - Subquery 1: Filter `probability` for SNII with probability > 0.6 and ranking=1.\n   - Subquery 2: Filter `object` for time range overlap.\n   - Subquery 3a: Filter `magstat` for g-band with `dmdt_first > 0.5` and `ndet > 30`.\n   - Subquery 3b: Filter `magstat` for r-band with `dmdt_first > 0.5`, `ndet > 30`, and observation duration >= 100 days.\n   - Intersect subqueries 3a and 3b on `oid`.\n   - Join subqueries 1, 2, and the intersection of 3a and 3b on `oid`.\n   - Use the resulting `oid` list to filter `detection` table.\n   - Select and rename columns as requested.\n\nThis decomposition ensures the query is efficient, uses appropriate joins and intersections, applies all filters correctly, and returns the requested data with the correct column names and conditions.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4342, "completion_tokens": 1316, "total_tokens": 5658, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5"}}, "error": null}

From the `probability` table:\n     - Select objects (`oid`) where `class_name` = 'SNII'.\n     - Use `classifier_name` = 'lc_classifier'.\n     - Use `ranking` = 1 to get the most likely class.\n     -

Since `magstat` is per band, we need to:\n     - Create two subqueries or use a self-join on `magstat` filtered by `oid`:\n       - One for `fid`=1 with `dmdt_first` > 0.5.\n       - One for `fid`=2 with `dmdt_first` > 0.5.\n     - Intersect or join these subqueries on `oid` to get objects satisfying the rise rate condition in both bands.\n\n6. **Filter Objects by Time Range (2019-2022):**\n   - Use the `object` table's `firstmjd` and `lastmjd` columns to ensure the object was observed within the Modified Julian Date range corresponding to 2019-2022:\n     - `firstmjd` <= 59944.0 (end of 2022)\n     - `lastmjd` >= 58484.0 (start of 2019)\n   - This ensures the object has observations overlapping the requested time period.\n\n7. **Retrieve Detection Information:**\n   -

`sigmapsf` (magnitude error)\n     - `fid` (band identifier) \u2014 rename this column as `f_id` in the output\n     - `mjd` (time of detection)\n   - No additional filters on detections are specified, so include all detections for the filtered objects.\n\n8. **Final Output and Ordering:**\n   - Select the columns as specified.\n   - Rename `fid` as `f_id`.\n   - Optionally, order the results by `oid` and `mjd` to have detections sorted by object and time.\n\n9. **Summary of Joins and Filters:**\n   - Start with `probability` filtered by class, classifier, ranking, and probability.\n   - Join with `object` to filter by `ndet` and time range.\n   - Join with `magstat` twice or use subqueries to filter by initial rise rate in g and r bands and observation duration in r-band.\n   - Join with `detection` to retrieve detection-level data.\n   \n10. **Additional Notes:**\n    - Ensure that all joins use the `oid` column.\n    - Use INNER JOINs to ensure only objects meeting all criteria are included.\n    - Use the default conditions for the `probability` table as specified.\n    - Use the exact class name 'SNII' as per the database.\n    - Use the exact filter IDs: 1 for g-band, 2 for r-band.\n    - Use the MJD dates for the time range filter as provided.\n    - Rename `fid` to `f_id` in the final SELECT clause.\n\nBy following these steps, the resulting query will efficiently retrieve the requested information about SN II objects observed between 2019 and 2022, with the specified probability, rise rate, observation duration, and detection count, including detailed detection data with renamed band identifiers.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4342, "completion_tokens": 1185, "total_tokens": 5527, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5"}}, "error": null}

Since the user explicitly requests star/galaxy score from SExtractor, and the schema does not provide a direct column, this needs to be clarified or assumed to be `detection.rb`.\n     - The condition is: `ABS(ps1_ztf.sgscore1 - detection.rb) < 0.5`.\n   \n3. **Determine Columns to Return:**\n   - For the ZTF object:\n     - `object.oid` (ZTF identifier)\n     - `probability.probability` (probability of being AGN)\n   - For each epoch (detection):\n     - `detection.candid` (candidate identifier)\n     - `detection.fid` (filter identifier)\n     - Reduced chi-square: This column is not explicitly present in the schema. It might be a derived or stored value under a different name or not available. If not available, this needs to be clarified or omitted.\n     - Star/galaxy score from SExtractor: assumed to be `detection.rb` or another column if specified.\n     - For the nearest PS1 source:\n       - `ps1_ztf.objectidps1` (identifier of the nearest PS1 source)\n       - `ps1_ztf.sgscore1` (PS1 star/galaxy score)\n       - `ps1_ztf.distpsnr1` (distance to nearest PS1 source)\n   \n4. **Establish Table Joins:**\n   - Join `probability` with `object` on `oid`.\n   - Join `ps1_ztf` with `object` on `oid`.\n   - Join `detection` with `object` on `oid`.\n   - This will allow retrieving all required columns and applying filters.\n   \n5. **Apply Filters in WHERE Clause:**\n   - Filter on `probability` table for class_name, classifier_name, classifier_version, ranking, and probability.\n   - Filter on `ps1_ztf.distpsnr1 < 2`.\n   - Filter on the absolute difference between `ps1_ztf.sgscore1` and `detection.rb` less than 0.5.\n   \n6. **Limit the Number of Results:**\n   - Since the user requests at most 50 objects, apply a limit of 50 on the number of distinct objects.\n   - Because multiple detections (epochs) per object can exist, the query should limit the number of objects first, then retrieve all detections for those objects.\n   - This can be done by:\n     - First selecting up to 50 `oid`s that satisfy the conditions.\n     - Then retrieving all detections for those `oid`s.\n   \n7. **Ordering and Sorting:**\n   - The user does not specify ordering, so default ordering can be by probability descending or by object identifier.\n   \n8. **Final Output Structure:**\n   - The query should return rows with columns:\n     - `oid` (ZTF object identifier)\n     - `probability` (probability of AGN classification)\n     - `candid` (candidate identifier for each detection)\n     - `fid` (filter identifier)\n     - Reduced chi-square (if available; otherwise, note its absence)\n     - Star/galaxy score from SExtractor (assumed `detection.rb`)\n     - `objectidps1` (nearest PS1 source identifier)\n     - `sgscore1` (PS1 star/galaxy score)\n     - `distpsnr1` (distance to nearest PS1 source)\n   \n9. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Verify the presence and meaning of the reduced chi-square column; if not present, clarify or omit.\n   - Confirm the correct column for the star/galaxy score from SExtractor; if not available, clarify or omit.\n   - Ensure that the joins do not multiply rows unnecessarily; use appropriate join types (INNER JOIN) and conditions.\n   - Use indexes on `probability.oid`, `ps1_ztf.oid`, and `detection.oid` for performance.\n   - Use subqueries or CTEs to first filter the 50 objects, then join to detections and PS1 data.\n   \nBy following these steps, the resulting query will efficiently retrieve up to 50 ZTF objects classified as AGN with high confidence, close to a PS1 source, and with similar star/galaxy scores between PS1 and SExtractor, including detailed detection epoch information.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4120, "completion_tokens": 1343, "total_tokens": 5463, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5"}}, "error": null}

since the schema does not explicitly mention SExtractor star/galaxy score, verify if it is stored in `detection` or if it needs to be inferred or joined from another table; if not available, clarify or assume it is in `detection` as `sgscore` or a similar column), and reduced chi-square (not explicitly listed in the schema, so check if it is stored under a different name or if it needs to be calculated or omitted if unavailable).\n   \n2. **Clarify Columns for SExtractor Star/Galaxy Score and Reduced Chi-Square:**\n   - Since the schema does not explicitly mention a column for the SExtractor star/galaxy score or reduced chi-square in the `detection` table, confirm if these are stored under different column names or if additional tables are needed.\n   - If these columns are not present, the query cannot retrieve them directly; the user should be informed or the query adjusted accordingly.\n   \n3. **Set Filtering Conditions:**\n   - From the `probability` table:\n     - Filter for `class_name = 'AGN'`.\n     - Filter for `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'` (default condition).\n     - Filter for `classifier_version = 'hierarchical_rf_1.1.0'`.\n     - Filter for `probability > 0.7`.\n     - Filter for `ranking = 1` (default condition to get the most likely class).\n   - From the `ps1_ztf` table:\n     - Filter for `distpsnr1 < 2` (distance to nearest PS1 source less than 2 arcseconds).\n   - For the difference between the star/galaxy score from PS1 and SExtractor:\n     - Calculate the absolute difference between `sgscore1` (PS1 star/galaxy score) and the SExtractor star/galaxy score (assumed to be in `detection` or another table).\n     - Filter for this difference to be less than 0.5.\n   \n4. **Join Tables Appropriately:**\n   - Join `probability` with `object` on `oid` to get the ZTF object identifier.\n   - Join `ps1_ztf` on `oid` to get PS1 source information.\n   - Join `detection` on `oid` to get epoch-level data (candidate id, filter id, SExtractor star/galaxy score, reduced chi-square).\n   - Ensure that the joins are INNER JOINs to only include objects that have matching entries in all tables.\n   \n5. **Select Required Columns:**\n   - From `object` or `probability`:\n     - ZTF object identifier (`oid`).\n     - Probability of being AGN (`probability`).\n   - From `detection`:\n     - Candidate identifier (`candid`).\n     - Filter identifier (`fid`).\n     - Reduced chi-square (if available; otherwise, note its absence).\n     - SExtractor star/galaxy score (assumed column).\n   - From `ps1_ztf`:\n     - Identifier of the nearest PS1 source (`objectidps1`).\n     - PS1 star/galaxy score (`sgscore1`).\n     - Distance to nearest PS1 source (`distpsnr1`).\n   \n6. **Limit the Number of Results:**\n   - Limit the output to at most 50 distinct ZTF objects.\n   - Since multiple epochs per object are requested, decide whether to limit the total number of rows or the number of objects.\n   - To ensure at most 50 objects, use a subquery or CTE to first select the 50 objects meeting the conditions, then join to detections to get all epochs for those objects.\n   \n7. **Ordering and Presentation:**\n   - Optionally order the results by probability descending to prioritize the most probable AGN.\n   - Present the results with clear column aliases if needed for clarity.\n   \n8. **Summary of Steps to Implement in the Query:**\n   - Step 1: Filter `probability` for AGN class, classifier version, ranking=1, and probability > 0.7.\n   - Step 2: Join with `ps1_ztf` and filter for `distpsnr1 < 2`.\n   - Step 3: Join with `detection` and filter for absolute difference between `sgscore1` and SExtractor star/galaxy score < 0.5.\n   - Step 4: Select distinct `oid` from the above with a limit of 50.\n   - Step 5: Join back to `detection` and `ps1_ztf` to retrieve all epochs for those 50 objects.\n   - Step 6: Select the requested columns.\n   \n9. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Verify the exact column name for the SExtractor star/galaxy score and reduced chi-square in the `detection` table or elsewhere.\n   - If reduced chi-square is not available, consider omitting it or clarifying with the user.\n   - Use appropriate indexes for performance, especially on `probability(oid)`, `ps1_ztf(oid)`, and `detection(oid)`.\n   - Use explicit filtering on `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'` as per default conditions.\n   \nBy following this decomposition plan, the resulting query will efficiently retrieve up to 50 ZTF objects classified as AGN with high confidence, close to a PS1 source, and with consistent star/galaxy scores between PS1 and SExtractor, including detailed epoch-level information.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4120, "completion_tokens": 1352, "total_tokens": 5472, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5"}}, "error": null}
