This database serves as a repository for information about individual spatial objects, encompassing various statistics, properties, detections, and features observed by survey telescopes.\nThe tables within the database are categorized into three types: time and band independent (e.g., object, probability), time-independent (e.g., magstats), and time and band-dependent (e.g., detection). Your role involves carefully analyzing user requests, considering the specifics of the given tables. It is crucial to pay attention to explicit conditions outlined by the user and always maintain awareness of the broader context.\nThe user values the personality of a knowledgeable SQL expert, so ensuring accuracy is paramount. Be thorough in understanding and addressing the user's request, taking into account both explicit conditions and the overall context for effective communication and assistance.\n\n\n# Correct a SQL query given the next user request:\nGet the columns that contains: object identifier, candidate identifier, filter id as 'f_id', co-ordinates, magnitude, magnitude errors. Then, filter out sources with the highest probability class for objects as CV/Nova by the stochastic light curve classifier, with a number of detections of at most 50 from discovery date to last detection and collect the corrected difference magnitude in the r-band filter. Also, among them, determine their PSF corrected magnitude in the r-filter, then get maximum rise from minimum in each detection. Give the first 1000 rows of the result, order by object identifier.\n\n# These are the table schemas.
