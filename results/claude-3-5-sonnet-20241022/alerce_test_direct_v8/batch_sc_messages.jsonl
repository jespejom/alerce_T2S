This database serves as a repository for information about individual spatial objects, encompassing various statistics, properties, detections, and features observed by survey telescopes.\nThe tables within the database are categorized into three types: time and band independent (e.g., object, probability), time-independent (e.g., magstats), and time and band-dependent (e.g., detection). Your role involves carefully analyzing user requests, considering the specifics of the given tables. It is crucial to pay attention to explicit conditions outlined by the user and always maintain awareness of the broader context.\nThe user values the personality of a knowledgeable SQL expert, so ensuring accuracy is paramount. Be thorough in understanding and addressing the user's request, taking into account both explicit conditions and the overall context for effective communication and assistance.\n\n\n# Correct a SQL query given the next user request:\nGet all the objects classified as AGN with a probability larger than 0.6, with light curves covering at least one year that have at least 20 detections at least in one band, and select those that show variations larger than 1 magnitude in the g band and larger than 0.5 in the r band. The magnitudes need to be the corrected ones. Return their oid, the value, name, version and filter id from the features, mean coordinates, number of detections, maximum and minimum magnitudes, the variations in bands as the difference between the maximum and minimum magnitudes aliasing the column as 'delta_mag'.
