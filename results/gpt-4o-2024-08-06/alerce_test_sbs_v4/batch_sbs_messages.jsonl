For example, you might want to order by `probability` in descending order to see the highest probabilities first.\n\n7. **Document the Query:**\n   - Clearly document each part of the query to explain the purpose of the joins, filters, and selected columns.\n\nBy following these steps, you can systematically construct a query that retrieves the desired information from the ALeRCE database, ensuring that all conditions and requirements are met.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

The request involves retrieving objects classified as AGN that show variability in the r band but have no detections or show no variability in the g band. The results should be ordered by feature value in ascending order and by oid. Here is the detailed decomposition plan:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**\n   - Use the `probability` table to filter objects classified as AGN.\n   - Use the `feature` table to check for variability in the r band and no detections or variability in the g band.\n   - Use the `object` table to retrieve additional object information if needed.\n\n2. **Filter Objects Classified as AGN:**\n   - Create a sub-query on the `probability` table to select objects where `class_name` is 'AGN', `classifier_name` is 'lc_classifier', and `ranking` is 1. This ensures we only consider the most likely classification.\n\n3. **Check for Variability in the r Band:**\n   - Create a sub-query on the `feature` table to select features related to variability in the r band. This could involve features like `Amplitude`, `Std`, or `ExcessVar` with `fid` = 2 (r band).\n   - Use an INNER JOIN with the AGN sub-query to ensure only AGN objects are considered.\n\n4. **Check for No Detections or No Variability in the g Band:**\n   - Create another sub-query on the `feature` table to select features indicating no detections or no variability in the g band. This could involve checking for features like `n_det` = 0 or `Amplitude`, `Std`, or `ExcessVar` with `fid` = 1 (g band) being below a certain threshold.\n   - Use an INNER JOIN with the AGN sub-query to ensure only AGN objects are considered.\n\n5. **Combine Feature Sub-Queries:**\n   - Use a UNION to combine the sub-queries for the r band and g band features.\n   - Use an INTERSECT to find objects that meet both conditions: variability in the r band and no detections or variability in the g band.\n\n6. **Filter and Order Results:**\n   - Filter the UNION query to select only the oids that are in the INTERSECT query.\n   - Order the features by their value in ascending order.\n   - Order the final results by `oid`.\n\n7. **Select Final Columns:**\n   - If the user does not specify explicit columns, use `SELECT *` to retrieve all columns from the final result set.\n\nBy following these steps, you can construct a query that retrieves the desired objects and orders them as specified.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Return the objects classified as AGN that show variability in the r band, but have no detections or show no variability in the g band.

The request involves retrieving objects classified as AGN that show variability in the r band but have no detections or show no variability in the g band. We also need to order the features by their value in ascending order and the final query by oid. Here is the detailed decomposition plan:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**\n   - Use the `probability` table to filter objects classified as AGN.\n   - Use the `magstat` table to check for variability in the r band and no detections or no variability in the g band.\n   - Use the `feature` table to retrieve and order features by their value.\n\n2. **Filter Objects Classified as AGN:**\n   - Create a sub-query on the `probability` table to select objects where `class_name` is 'AGN', `classifier_name` is 'lc_classifier', and `ranking` is 1. This ensures we only consider the most likely classification.\n\n3. **Check Variability in the r Band:**\n   - Create a sub-query on the `magstat` table to select objects with variability in the r band. Variability can be determined by checking if the `magsigma` or `magsigma_corr` is above a certain threshold for `fid` = 2 (r band). The threshold can be determined based on domain knowledge or set to a default value.\n\n4. **Check No Detections or No Variability in the g Band:**\n   - Create another sub-query on the `magstat` table to select objects with no detections or no variability in the g band. This can be done by checking if `ndet` is 0 or if `magsigma` or `magsigma_corr` is below a certain threshold for `fid` = 1 (g band).\n\n5. **Combine Sub-Queries for Variability Conditions:**\n   - Use an `INTERSECT` operation to combine the sub-query for variability in the r band with the sub-query for no detections or no variability in the g band. This will give us objects that meet both conditions.\n\n6. **Retrieve and Order Features:**\n   - For each feature of interest, create a sub-query on the `feature` table to retrieve the feature values for the objects identified in the previous step. Use an `INNER JOIN` with the result of the `INTERSECT` operation to ensure only relevant objects are considered.\n   - Use an `ORDER BY` clause to order the features by their value in ascending order.\n\n7. **Combine Feature Sub-Queries:**\n   - Use a `UNION` operation to combine the sub-queries for each feature. This will give us a combined list of features for the relevant objects.\n\n8. **Filter Combined Features:**\n   - Use an `INTERSECT` operation to filter the combined features, ensuring only objects that meet all feature conditions are included.\n\n9. **Order Final Results:**\n   - Use an `ORDER BY` clause to order the final results by `oid`.\n\n10. **Assemble the Final Query:**\n    - Combine all the sub-queries and operations into a single query that retrieves the desired information.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically construct a query that meets the user's request, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Return the objects classified as AGN that show variability in the r band, but have no detections or show no variability in the g band.

The query will involve multiple tables, including `object`, `probability`, `detection`, and `feature`. We will use JOINs, subqueries, and filtering conditions to retrieve the desired information. Here is the detailed decomposition plan:\n\n1. **Filter Objects by Classification and Probability:**\n   - Start by filtering the `probability` table to select objects classified as 'AGN' with a probability greater than 0.6.\n   - Use the default conditions: `probability.ranking = 1` and `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`.\n   - Create a subquery to retrieve the `oid` of these objects.\n\n2. **Filter Objects by Light Curve Duration and Number of Detections:**\n   - Use the `object` table to filter objects with light curves covering at least one year. This can be determined by checking if the difference between `mjdendhist` and `mjdstarthist` is greater than or equal to 365 days.\n   - Ensure that the object has at least 20 detections in at least one band. This can be checked using the `ndet` column in the `object` table.\n   - Join this result with the subquery from step 1 to ensure only objects meeting both criteria are selected.\n\n3. **Filter Objects by Magnitude Variations:**\n   - Use the `detection` table to calculate the magnitude variations in the g and r bands.\n   - For the g band (fid = 1), calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum `magpsf_corr` values and ensure it is greater than 1.\n   - For the r band (fid = 2), calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum `magpsf_corr` values and ensure it is greater than 0.5.\n   - Use subqueries to calculate these variations and join them with the result from step 2.\n\n4. **Retrieve Feature Information:**\n   - For each object, retrieve the `oid`, `value`, `name`, `version`, and `fid` from the `feature` table.\n   - Use the default condition for handling multiple features: create subqueries for each feature, perform a UNION, and then an INTERSECT to ensure all features are associated with the same objects.\n   - Join the result with the filtered objects from step 3.\n\n5. **Select and Alias Required Columns:**\n   - From the final result, select the following columns:\n     - `oid` from the `object` table.\n     - `value`, `name`, `version`, and `fid` from the `feature` table, aliasing `fid` as `feature_fid`.\n     - `meanra` and `meandec` from the `object` table for mean coordinates.\n     - `ndet` from the `object` table for the number of detections.\n     - Maximum and minimum `magpsf_corr` values from the `detection` table for both g and r bands.\n     - Calculate the magnitude variations as the difference between maximum and minimum magnitudes, aliasing these columns as `delta_mag`.\n\n6. **Compile the Final Query:**\n   - Combine all the subqueries and joins to form the final query.\n   - Ensure all conditions and aliases are correctly applied.\n   - Test the query to verify it returns the expected results.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically construct a complex query that retrieves the desired information from the ALeRCE database.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Get all the objects classified as AGN with a probability larger than 0.6, with light curves covering at least one year that have at least 20 detections at least in one band, and select those that show variations larger than 1 magnitude in the g band and larger than 0.5 in the r band.

This can be determined by checking if `deltajd` is greater than or equal to 365 days.\n   - Ensure that there are at least 20 detections in at least one band by checking the `ndet` column.\n\n4. **Filter by Magnitude Variations in Specific Bands:**\n   - Use the `detection` table to calculate the magnitude variations in the g and r bands.\n   - For the g band (`fid = 1`), ensure the difference between the maximum and minimum corrected magnitudes (`magpsf_corr`) is greater than 1.\n   - For the r band (`fid = 2`), ensure the difference between the maximum and minimum corrected magnitudes is greater than 0.5.\n\n5. **Retrieve Required Information:**\n   - From the `object` table, retrieve `oid`, `meanra`, `meandec`, and `ndet`.\n   - From the `feature` table, retrieve `value`, `name`, `version`, and `fid` (alias as `feature_fid`).\n   - Calculate the maximum and minimum corrected magnitudes for each band and compute the magnitude variations, aliasing the column as `delta_mag`.\n\n6. **Combine Results Using Subqueries and Joins:**\n   - Create a subquery to filter objects based on the `probability` table conditions.\n   - Create subqueries for each feature condition, joining with the `probability` subquery to ensure only relevant objects are considered.\n   - Use `UNION` and `INTERSECT` operations to handle the transposed nature of the `feature` table.\n   - Join the results with the `object` and `detection` tables to gather all required information.\n\n7. **Apply Final Conditions and Formatting:**\n   - Ensure the final result set includes only objects that meet all specified conditions.\n   - Format the output to include the required columns with appropriate aliases.\n\nBy following these steps, you can construct a complex query that retrieves the desired information from the ALeRCE database, adhering to the specified conditions and formatting requirements.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Get all the objects classified as AGN with a probability larger than 0.6, with light curves covering at least one year that have at least 20 detections at least in one band, and select those that show variations larger than 1 magnitude in the g band and larger than 0.5 in the r band.

If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nTo generate the required PostgreSQL query, we need to decompose the user request into a series of systematic steps. The query involves multiple tables, conditions, and requires the use of JOINs, subqueries, and specific filtering criteria. Here's a detailed decomposition plan:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**\n   - The main tables involved are `object`, `probability`, `detection`, `non_detection`, and `magstat`.\n   - Key columns include `oid`, `probability`, `class_name`, `classifier_name`, `mjd`, `fid`, `diffmaglim`, `dmdt_first`, and `dm_first`.\n\n2. **Filter Objects by First Detection Date:**\n   - Use the `detection` table to filter objects with their first detection (`mjd`) between September 01 and September 02 (MJD 60188.0 to 60189.0).\n   - Create a subquery to select `oid` from `detection` where `mjd` is within this range.\n\n3. **Filter by Fast Riser Criteria:**\n   - Use the `magstat` table to identify objects that qualify as fast risers.\n   - Filter objects where `dmdt_first` is greater than or equal to 0.25.\n   - Create a subquery to select `oid` from `magstat` where `dmdt_first >= 0.25`.\n\n4. **Filter by Stamp Classifier Probability:**\n   - Use the `probability` table to filter objects with the highest probability in the `stamp_classifier` for class 'SN'.\n   - Apply default conditions: `probability.ranking = 1` and `probability.classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`.\n   - Create a subquery to select `oid` from `probability` where `class_name = 'SN'`.\n\n5. **Combine Filters Using INTERSECT:**\n   - Combine the subqueries from steps 2, 3, and 4 using the `INTERSECT` operation to get `oids` that satisfy all conditions.\n\n6. **Retrieve Non-Detection Information:**\n   - Use the `non_detection` table to retrieve non-detection information for the filtered `oids`.\n   - Select `oid`, `fid`, and `diffmaglim`.\n\n7. **Retrieve Light Curve Information:**\n   - Use the `detection` table to retrieve light curve information for the filtered `oids`.\n   - Select `oid`, `fid`, `diffmaglim`, and other relevant columns.\n\n8. **Retrieve Probability Information:**\n   - Use the `probability` table to retrieve probability information for the filtered `oids`.\n   - Select `oid`, `probability`, and other relevant columns.\n\n9. **Retrieve Magstat Information:**\n   - Use the `magstat` table to retrieve `magstat_fid` and initial rise estimate for the filtered `oids`.\n   - Select `oid`, `fid` as `magstat_fid`, and other relevant columns.\n\n10. **Combine Results Using JOINs:**\n    - Use `INNER JOIN` to combine results from the `non_detection`, `detection`, `probability`, and `magstat` tables based on the filtered `oids`.\n    - Ensure that all relevant columns are included in the final result set.\n\n11. **Order and Limit Results:**\n    - Order the final results by `oid`.\n    - Limit the results to 100 rows to meet the time constraints.\n\n12. **Final Output:**\n    - Ensure the final output includes `oid`, `probability`, `fid`, `diffmaglim`, `magstat_fid`, and any other requested columns.\n    - Verify that all conditions and requirements are met in the final query.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically construct a complex SQL query that retrieves the desired information from the ALeRCE database.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: \n-- mjd date for September 01 = 60188.0\n-- mjd date for September 02 = 60189.0\nDomain Knowledge: \n-- A fast riser is defined as an object whose first detection is brighter by at least a rate of 0.25 magnitudes/day than the last non-detection obtained before the first detection (both first detection and last non-detection are in the same filter)\n\n # User Request: '' Get the object identifiers, probabilities in the stamp classifier and light curves (including only non-detections) for objects whose highest probability in the stamp classifier is obtained for class SN, had their first detection in the first 2 days of september, and qualify as fast risers.

This involves checking if `dmdt_first` is greater than or equal to 0.25.\n   - Join the `magstat` table with the `object` table using `oid`.\n\n4. **Filter by Stamp Classifier Probability:**\n   - Use the `probability` table to filter objects where the highest probability (`ranking = 1`) in the `stamp_classifier` is for class 'SN'.\n   - Ensure the `probability` table is joined with the `object` table using `oid`.\n\n5. **Retrieve Non-Detection Data:**\n   - Use the `non_detection` table to retrieve non-detection data for the filtered objects.\n   - Join the `non_detection` table with the `object` table using `oid`.\n\n6. **Select Required Columns:**\n   - From the `object` table, select `oid`.\n   - From the `probability` table, select `probability` where `class_name = 'SN'` and `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`.\n   - From the `detection` table, select `fid` and `diffmaglim`.\n   - From the `magstat` table, select `fid` as `magstat_fid` and `dmdt_first` as the initial rise estimate.\n\n7. **Combine Data Using Joins:**\n   - Use INNER JOINs to combine data from the `object`, `probability`, `detection`, `non_detection`, and `magstat` tables based on `oid`.\n   - Ensure that the joins respect the filtering criteria for each table.\n\n8. **Order and Limit Results:**\n   - Order the final results by `oid`.\n   - Limit the results to 100 rows to meet the time constraints.\n\n9. **Ensure Default Conditions:**\n   - Ensure that the `probability` table uses the default conditions: `ranking = 1` and `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`, unless specified otherwise.\n\nBy following these steps, we can construct a complex query that retrieves the desired information from the ALeRCE database, ensuring that all conditions and requirements are met.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

This will allow you to filter the main query to only include these specific objects.\n\n3. **Filter by Deep Learning Real Bogus Score:**\n   - In the `detection` table, apply a `WHERE` clause to filter objects with a `drb` (deep learning real bogus score) greater than 0.5.\n\n4. **Filter by Star Galaxy Score or Distance to Nearest Source:**\n   - Use a `JOIN` between the `detection` and `ps1_ztf` tables on the `oid` column to access the `sgscore1` and `distpsnr1` columns.\n   - Apply a `WHERE` clause to filter objects that either have `sgscore1` less than 0.5 or `distpsnr1` less than 1 arcsec.\n\n5. **Select the Required Columns:**\n   - From the filtered results, select the following columns: `oid`, `candid`, `fid`, `mjd`, `magpsf`, `sigmapsf`, `has_stamp`, `drb`, `sgscore1`, and `distpsnr1`.\n\n6. **Combine the Conditions:**\n   - Ensure that all conditions are combined using logical operators (`AND`, `OR`) to accurately reflect the user's request. Specifically, the conditions for `drb`, `sgscore1`, and `distpsnr1` should be combined to filter the results correctly.\n\n7. **Execute the Query:**\n   - The final query should retrieve the data from the `detection` and `ps1_ztf` tables, applying all the specified filters and selecting the required columns.\n\nBy following these steps, you will be able to construct a query that retrieves the desired information for the specified list of `oids`, considering the conditions on the deep learning real bogus score, star galaxy score, and distance to the nearest source in Pan-STARRS.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

Here's a detailed decomposition plan:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**\n   - The `detection` table contains information about object detections, including `oid`, `candid`, `fid`, `mjd`, `magpsf`, `sigmapsf`, `has_stamp`, and `drb`.\n   - The `ps1_ztf` table contains information about the nearest sources in Pan-STARRS, including `oid`, `candid`, `sgscore1`, and `distpsnr1`.\n\n2. **Filter by OIDs:**\n   - Create a subquery or a temporary table using a `WITH` clause to filter the `detection` table for the specified list of oids: ['ZTF23aavzgjg', 'ZTF23aaynzyk', 'ZTF23aavqxos', 'ZTF23aaknyni', 'ZTF23aavsdtc', 'ZTF18aandkua', 'ZTF23aaxfewt', 'ZTF23aavshwi', 'ZTF22aawasao', 'ZTF23aaxgvnt'].\n\n3. **Apply Conditions on `detection` Table:**\n   - Filter the results from the `detection` table where `drb` (deep learning real bogus score) is greater than 0.5.\n\n4. **Join with `ps1_ztf` Table:**\n   - Perform an `INNER JOIN` between the filtered `detection` results and the `ps1_ztf` table on `oid` and `candid` to retrieve the `sgscore1` (star galaxy score of the nearest object) and `distpsnr1` (distance to the nearest source in Pan-STARRS).\n\n5. **Apply Additional Conditions:**\n   - Further filter the joined results to include only those records where either `sgscore1` is less than 0.5 or `distpsnr1` is smaller than 1 arcsec.\n\n6. **Select Required Columns:**\n   - From the filtered results, select the following columns: `oid` (unique object identifier), `candid` (candidate identifier), `fid` (filter identifier), `mjd` (modified julian date), `magpsf` (magnitude), `sigmapsf` (magnitude error), `has_stamp` (whether the object has stamps), `drb` (deep learning real bogus score), `sgscore1` (star galaxy score of the nearest object), and `distpsnr1` (distance to the nearest source in Pan-STARRS).\n\n7. **Order the Results:**\n   - Optionally, order the results by `oid` or any other relevant column if a specific order is required.\n\nBy following these steps, you can construct a query that retrieves the desired information from the ALeRCE database, applying the specified conditions and joins.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''For the next list of oids: ['ZTF23aavzgjg' 'ZTF23aaynzyk' 'ZTF23aavqxos' 'ZTF23aaknyni'\n 'ZTF23aavsdtc' 'ZTF18aandkua' 'ZTF23aaxfewt' 'ZTF23aavshwi'\n 'ZTF22aawasao' 'ZTF23aaxgvnt'], return the unique object identifier, candidate identifier, filter identifier, modified julian date, magnitud, magnitud error, whether the object has stamps, deep learning real bogus score, the star galaxy score of the nearest object, and the distance to the nearest source in panstarrs for objects that have a deep learning real bogus score greater than 0.5 and that either have a star galaxy score less than 0.5 or a distance to the nearest panstarrs source smaller than 1 arcsec.''"}], "max_completion_tokens": 4000, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "n": 1}}

According to the general context, the relevant class name is `'SN'`.\n   - Ensure the `probability` is greater than 0.7 as specified by the user.\n\n4. **Join Tables:**\n   - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `probability` and `dataquality` tables. The join should be based on the `oid` column, which is common to both tables.\n\n5. **Select Columns:**\n   - Since the user wants all columns from the `dataquality` table, ensure the query selects all columns from this table.\n\n6. **Limit the Number of Results:**\n   - Use a `LIMIT` clause to restrict the number of results to at most 50, as specified by the user.\n\n7. **Order the Results (Optional):**\n   - If there is no specific order required by the user, the results can be returned in any order. However, if needed, you can order by `probability` in descending order to prioritize higher probabilities.\n\nBy following these steps, you can construct a query that retrieves the desired information from the ALeRCE database.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Find at most 50 ZTF objects that have a probability larger than 0.7 of being supernovae in the stamp classifier.

The relevant class name in the `stamp_classifier` is 'SN'.\n   - Set the condition for probability: `probability.probability > 0.7`.\n\n4. **Design the Query:**\n   - Start by selecting from the `probability` table where the conditions are met.\n   - Use an `INNER JOIN` to connect the `probability` table with the `dataquality` table on the `oid` column, as this is the common key between the two tables.\n   - Ensure that all columns from the `dataquality` table are selected.\n\n5. **Limit the Number of Results:**\n   - Use the `LIMIT` clause to restrict the number of results to at most 50 objects.\n\n6. **Document the Query:**\n   - Clearly document the purpose of the query, the tables involved, and the conditions applied.\n   - Explain any assumptions made, such as the use of default conditions for the `probability` table.\n\nBy following these steps, you can systematically construct a query that retrieves the desired information from the ALeRCE database.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Find at most 200 ZTF objects that satisfy the following conditions: have a distance to the nearest PS1 source larger than 5 arcsec, and have a probability larger than 0.7 of being in a class other than supernova in the light curve classifier.

Also, ensure `ranking` is 1 as per default conditions.\n   - Use an INNER JOIN with the `object` table on the `oid` column to filter objects with `firstmjd` greater than 60310.\n   - Use an INNER JOIN with the `forced_photometry` table on the `oid` column to retrieve all columns from this table for the filtered objects.\n   - Apply a `LIMIT` clause to restrict the number of results to 10.\n   - Use an `ORDER BY` clause to sort the results by `firstmjd`.\n\n4. **Ensure Default Conditions:**\n   - Ensure that the `probability` table conditions include `ranking = 1` and `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'` as per the default conditions.\n\n5. **Document the Query:**\n   - Clearly document each part of the query to explain the purpose of the joins, filters, and sorting.\n   - Note any assumptions or limitations, such as the use of default conditions for the `probability` table.\n\nBy following these steps, you can systematically construct a query that retrieves the desired information from the ALeRCE database.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Find at most 10 ZTF objects that have a first detection date later than mjd=60310 days, as well as a probability of 1 of being an asteroid in the stamp classifier, ordered by the first detection date.

For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Find at most 10 ZTF objects that satisfy the following conditions: have more than 500 detections, a probability larger than 0.5 of being an asteroid in the stamp classifier version 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4', and a distance from the nearest Solar System object below 2 arcsec.

This means filtering the `xmatch` table where `oid` equals 'ZTF19aascdol'.\n   - Ensure that the `catid` in the `xmatch` table corresponds to the ALLWISE catalog. This can be done by checking the `catid` value that represents the ALLWISE catalog.\n\n3. **Determine the Required Columns:**\n   - From the `xmatch` table, retrieve the following columns:\n     - `oid` (ZTF object identifier)\n     - `oid_catalog` (identifier in the ALLWISE catalog)\n     - `dist` (distance between counterparts)\n   - From the `allwise` table, retrieve the following columns:\n     - `w1mpro`, `w2mpro`, `w3mpro`, `w4mpro` (magnitudes in WISE filters W1 to W4)\n\n4. **Design the Query:**\n   - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `xmatch` and `allwise` tables based on the `oid_catalog` column, which is common to both tables.\n   - Apply a `WHERE` clause to filter the results for the specific ZTF object 'ZTF19aascdol' and ensure the match is with the ALLWISE catalog.\n\n5. **Ensure All Columns are Selected:**\n   - Since the user did not specify any additional columns, ensure that all relevant columns from both tables are included in the `SELECT` statement.\n\n6. **Document the Query:**\n   - Although not part of the SQL code, document the purpose of the query and the logic behind the selection and joining of tables for future reference and clarity.\n\nBy following these steps, you will be able to construct a query that retrieves the required information about the ALLWISE matches for the specified ZTF object.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

It includes columns for the ZTF object identifier (`oid`), the catalog identifier (`oid_catalog`), and the distance between counterparts (`dist`).\n   - The `allwise` table is relevant because it contains information about the ALLWISE catalog objects, including their magnitudes in the WISE filters W1 to W4.\n\n2. **Define the Selection Criteria:**\n   - The query should focus on the ZTF object with the identifier 'ZTF19aascdol'. This means filtering the `xmatch` table where `oid` equals 'ZTF19aascdol'.\n   - Ensure that the `catid` in the `xmatch` table corresponds to the ALLWISE catalog. This can be done by checking the `catid` value that represents the ALLWISE catalog.\n\n3. **Determine the Required Columns:**\n   - From the `xmatch` table, select the following columns:\n     - `oid` (ZTF object identifier)\n     - `oid_catalog` (identifier in the ALLWISE catalog)\n     - `dist` (distance between counterparts)\n   - From the `allwise` table, select the following columns:\n     - `w1mpro`, `w2mpro`, `w3mpro`, `w4mpro` (magnitudes in WISE filters W1 to W4)\n\n4. **Establish the Join Condition:**\n   - Use an `INNER JOIN` between the `xmatch` and `allwise` tables. The join condition should be based on the `oid_catalog` column, which is common to both tables. This will allow you to retrieve the ALLWISE magnitudes for the matched object.\n\n5. **Construct the Query:**\n   - Start with a `SELECT` statement that includes all the required columns from both tables.\n   - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `xmatch` and `allwise` tables based on the `oid_catalog` column.\n   - Apply a `WHERE` clause to filter the results for the specific ZTF object 'ZTF19aascdol' and ensure the match is with the ALLWISE catalog.\n\n6. **Review and Test the Query:**\n   - Ensure that the query is correctly structured and that all table and column names are used as they appear in the database schema.\n   - Test the query to verify that it returns the expected results, including the correct identifiers, distance, and magnitudes.\n\nBy following these steps, you will be able to construct a query that retrieves the requested information about the ALLWISE match(es) for the ZTF object 'ZTF19aascdol'.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: Note that filters W1 to W4 means returning W1, W2, W3 and W4\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''For the ZTF object 'ZTF19aascdol' get the following information about its ALLWISE match(es): identifier in ZTF and in the catalog, distance between counterparts, and magnitudes in filters WISE W1 to W4''"}], "max_completion_tokens": 4000, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "n": 1}}

This involves joining the `ss_ztf` and `detection` tables on the `oid` column and applying the spatial filter.\n\n4. **Select the Required Columns:**\n   - From the `ss_ztf` table, select all columns.\n   - From the `detection` table, select the columns `mjd`, `fid`, `isdiffpos`, `ra`, `dec`, `magpsf`, and `sigmapsf`.\n\n5. **Sort the Results:**\n   - Sort the results first by `ssnamenr` (MPC name) and then by `mjd` (detection date).\n\n6. **Construct the Query:**\n   - Use an `INNER JOIN` between the `ss_ztf` and `detection` tables on the `oid` column.\n   - Apply the `q3c_radial_query` function in the `WHERE` clause to filter detections within 2 arcseconds.\n   - Ensure the `WHERE` clause also includes the filter for `ssnamenr` values '2003FP134' and '2009UK56'.\n   - Use `ORDER BY` to sort the results by `ssnamenr` and `mjd`.\n\nBy following these steps, you can construct a query that retrieves the desired information from the ALeRCE database.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

The query involves multiple conditions and requires joining data from different tables. Here is a detailed decomposition plan:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**\n   - The `object` table is needed to retrieve the ZTF identifier (`oid`), number of detections (`ndet`), and first detection date (`firstmjd`).\n   - The `probability` table is needed to retrieve classification probabilities for both the stamp classifier and the light curve classifier top level.\n\n2. **Define Selection Criteria:**\n   - Objects must have more than 10 detections (`ndet > 10`).\n   - Objects must have a probability greater than 0.7 of being classified as 'bogus' in the `stamp_classifier` with version 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'.\n   - Objects must have a probability greater than 0.9 of being classified as 'Transient' in the `lc_classifier_top`.\n\n3. **Formulate Subqueries for Classifications:**\n   - **Subquery 1 (Stamp Classifier):** \n     - Filter the `probability` table for objects classified as 'bogus' with `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'` and `classifier_version = 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'`.\n     - Ensure the `probability` is greater than 0.7.\n     - Select `oid` and `probability` (alias as `prob_stamp_bogus`).\n\n   - **Subquery 2 (Light Curve Classifier Top Level):**\n     - Filter the `probability` table for objects classified as 'Transient' with `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier_top'`.\n     - Ensure the `probability` is greater than 0.9.\n     - Select `oid` and `probability` (alias as `prob_lc_transient`).\n\n4. **Join Subqueries with Object Table:**\n   - Perform an `INNER JOIN` between the `object` table and the results of Subquery 1 on `oid`.\n   - Perform another `INNER JOIN` between the result of the previous join and Subquery 2 on `oid`.\n\n5. **Apply Additional Filters and Sorting:**\n   - Filter the joined result to include only objects with `ndet > 10`.\n   - Order the results by the ZTF identifier (`oid`) of objects classified as 'bogus' in the stamp classifier.\n\n6. **Limit the Number of Results:**\n   - Use the `LIMIT` clause to restrict the output to at most 30 objects.\n\n7. **Select Required Columns:**\n   - From the final joined and filtered result, select the following columns:\n     - `oid` (ZTF identifier)\n     - `ndet` (number of detections)\n     - `firstmjd` (first detection date)\n     - `prob_stamp_bogus` (probability in the stamp classifier)\n     - `prob_lc_transient` (probability in the light curve classifier top level)\n\nBy following these steps, you can construct a query that retrieves the desired information from the ALeRCE database, ensuring all conditions are met and the results are ordered and limited as specified.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

Ensure the `ranking` is 1 and the `classifier_name` is 'lc_classifier_stochastic'.\n\n3. **Filter by Number of Detections:**\n   - Use the `object` table to filter objects with a number of detections (`ndet`) of at most 50.\n\n4. **Filter by Corrected Difference Magnitude in r-band:**\n   - Use the `magstat` table to filter for the r-band filter (`fid = 2`) and retrieve the corrected difference magnitude (`magmean_corr`).\n\n5. **Determine PSF Corrected Magnitude in r-filter:**\n   - Use the `detection` table to retrieve the PSF corrected magnitude (`magpsf_corr`) for the r-filter (`fid = 2`).\n\n6. **Calculate Maximum Rise from Minimum in Each Detection:**\n   - Use the `detection` table to calculate the maximum rise from minimum magnitude for each detection. This involves finding the difference between the maximum and minimum `magpsf` values for each object.\n\n7. **Combine Results:**\n   - Use `INNER JOIN` to combine results from the `probability`, `object`, `detection`, and `magstat` tables based on the `oid`.\n   - Ensure that the `detection` table is filtered for the r-band (`fid = 2`) and that the `magstat` table is also filtered for the r-band.\n\n8. **Order and Limit Results:**\n   - Order the final result by `oid`.\n   - Limit the result to the first 1000 rows.\n\n9. **Select Required Columns:**\n   - Select the columns: `oid` (object identifier), `candid` (candidate identifier), `fid` as `f_id` (filter id), `ra`, `dec` (coordinates), `magpsf` (magnitude), `sigmapsf` (magnitude errors), `magmean_corr` (corrected difference magnitude), and the calculated maximum rise from minimum magnitude.\n\nBy following these steps, you will be able to construct a query that retrieves the desired information from the ALeRCE database, adhering to the specified conditions and requirements.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Get the columns that contains: object identifier, candidate identifier, filter id as 'f_id', co-ordinates, magnitude, magnitude errors.

The query involves multiple tables and requires filtering, joining, and aggregating data. Here is a detailed decomposition plan:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**\n   - The `object` table contains the object identifier (`oid`) and the number of detections (`ndet`).\n   - The `detection` table contains the candidate identifier (`candid`), filter identifier (`fid`), right ascension (`ra`), declination (`dec`), point spread function (PSF) difference magnitude (`magpsf`), and PSF difference magnitude error (`sigmapsf`).\n   - The `probability` table contains the classification probabilities and rankings, which will be used to filter objects classified as 'CV/Nova' by the 'lc_classifier_stochastic'.\n   - The `magstat` table contains corrected difference magnitudes (`magmean_corr`) and other magnitude statistics for specific filters.\n\n2. **Filter Objects by Classification:**\n   - Create a subquery to filter objects from the `probability` table where `class_name` is 'CV/Nova', `classifier_name` is 'lc_classifier_stochastic', and `ranking` is 1. This subquery will return the `oid` of objects that meet these criteria.\n\n3. **Filter Objects by Number of Detections:**\n   - Use the `object` table to filter objects with `ndet` less than or equal to 50. This will be combined with the classification filter using an INNER JOIN on `oid`.\n\n4. **Retrieve Detection Information:**\n   - From the `detection` table, select the `candid`, `fid`, `ra`, `dec`, `magpsf`, and `sigmapsf` for the filtered objects. Ensure that `fid` is 2 (r-band filter) for the corrected difference magnitude.\n\n5. **Calculate Maximum Rise from Minimum in Each Detection:**\n   - Use the `detection` table to calculate the maximum rise from the minimum magnitude for each object. This involves finding the difference between the maximum and minimum `magpsf` values for each `oid` where `fid` is 2.\n\n6. **Retrieve Corrected Magnitude in r-band:**\n   - From the `magstat` table, retrieve the `magmean_corr` for `fid` 2 (r-band filter) for the filtered objects.\n\n7. **Combine Results:**\n   - Use JOINs to combine the results from the `probability`, `object`, `detection`, and `magstat` tables based on `oid`.\n   - Ensure that the final result includes the columns: `oid`, `candid`, `fid` as 'f_id', `ra`, `dec`, `magpsf`, `sigmapsf`, `magmean_corr`, and the calculated maximum rise from minimum magnitude.\n\n8. **Order and Limit Results:**\n   - Order the final result by `oid`.\n   - Limit the result to the first 1000 rows.\n\nBy following these steps, you can construct a complex query that retrieves the desired information from the ALeRCE database, ensuring that all conditions and requirements are met.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.
