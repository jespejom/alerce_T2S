For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}]}}}

Objects must have 100 or more detections (`ndet >= 100` in the object table)\n2. Objects must be classified by the 'lc_classifier' (from probability table)\n3. Objects must be most likely classified as 'CEP' (Cepheid) with ranking = 1\n4. The classification probability must be greater than 0.76\n\n## Step 3: Plan the Table Join\nWe need to join the `object` and `probability` tables using the common field `oid` to connect object properties with their classification information.\n\n## Step 4: Select the Required Columns\nThe query should return the following columns:\n- From `object` table: oid, meanra, meandec, ndet, firstmjd, deltajd, g_r_max\n- From `probability` table: classifier_name, class_name, ranking, probability\n\n## Step 5: Apply Filtering Conditions\nThe WHERE clause should include:\n- `object.ndet >= 100` to ensure objects have at least 100 detections\n- `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'` to select objects classified by the light curve classifier\n- `probability.class_name = 'CEP'` to select only Cepheid classifications\n- `probability.ranking = 1` to ensure we're getting the most likely classification for each object\n- `probability.probability > 0.76` to filter for high-confidence classifications\n\n## Step 6: Consider Query Optimization\n- Use appropriate JOIN type (INNER JOIN is suitable here as we want objects that exist in both tables)\n- Leverage existing indexes on the `ndet` column in the object table and on the `oid`, `ranking`, and `probability` columns in the probability table\n\nThis decomposition plan provides a structured approach to generating a PostgreSQL query that will retrieve the requested information about high-confidence Cepheid classifications from the ALeRCE database.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

Start with a CTE (Common Table Expression) to identify objects with highest SN probability in stamp classifier\n2. Join with the `object` table to filter by first detection date\n3. Join with the `magstat` table to identify fast risers\n4. Join with the `non_detection` table to include non-detection data\n5. Select and format the required columns\n6. Order by `oid` and limit to 100 rows\n\nThis approach ensures we efficiently filter the data at each step, reducing the amount of data processed in subsequent steps, and clearly organizes the complex query logic.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}]}}}

The object ID must be in our list of specified oids\n2. The deep learning real bogus score (`drb`) must be greater than 0.5\n3. Either:\n   - The star galaxy score of the nearest object (`sgscore1`) is less than 0.5, OR\n   - The distance to the nearest source in Pan-STARRS (`distpsnr1`) is less than 1 arcsec\n\n## Step 5: Select the Required Columns\nSelect the following columns from the joined tables:\n- `detection.oid` (unique object identifier)\n- `detection.candid` (candidate identifier)\n- `detection.fid` (filter identifier)\n- `detection.mjd` (modified julian date)\n- `detection.magpsf` (magnitude)\n- `detection.sigmapsf` (magnitude error)\n- `detection.has_stamp` (whether the object has stamps)\n- `detection.drb` (deep learning real bogus score)\n- `ps1_ztf.sgscore1` (star galaxy score of the nearest object)\n- `ps1_ztf.distpsnr1` (distance to the nearest source in Pan-STARRS)\n\n## Step 6: Optimize the Query\n- Use the index on `detection.oid` to efficiently filter the objects\n- Consider the join order to minimize the number of rows processed\n- Use explicit column names rather than SELECT * for better performance\n\nThis decomposition plan provides a clear roadmap for generating an efficient PostgreSQL query that will retrieve the requested information for the specified objects while applying the required filtering conditions.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}]}}}

For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}]}}}

For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}]}}}

First, we need to identify objects that have at least 10 detections in the g band (fid=1)\n2. These detections must not have dubious corrections (dubious=FALSE)\n3. We'll need to count detections per object that meet these criteria\n\n## Step 3: Apply Classification Criteria\n1. Filter the probability table to include only:\n   - Records with ranking=1 (most likely classification)\n   - Records from the 'lc_classifier' (as specified in the default conditions)\n\n## Step 4: Join the Filtered Data\n1. Join the filtered detection counts with the probability information\n2. Use the object's oid as the joining key\n\n## Step 5: Select the Required Columns\n1. oid (ZTF identifier) from the object table\n2. classifier_version from the probability table\n3. class_name from the probability table\n4. probability value from the probability table\n\n## Step 6: Apply Ordering and Limit\n1. Order the results by oid in ascending order\n2. Limit the results to at most 500 records\n\n## Step 7: Optimize the Query\n1. Use a subquery to first identify objects meeting the detection criteria\n2. Join this result with the probability table\n3. Ensure proper indexing is leveraged (the database already has indexes on oid and ranking)\n\nThis approach ensures we efficiently filter the potentially large detection table first before joining with the probability table, which should improve query performance while meeting all the specified requirements.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}]}}}

Have more than 500 detections\n2. Have a probability > 0.5 of being an asteroid in the stamp classifier version 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'\n3. Have a distance from the nearest Solar System object below 2 arcsec\n4. Limit results to at most 10 objects\n5. Order results by first detection date\n\n## Step 2: Identify the Relevant Tables and Columns\nBased on the database schema:\n- `object` table: For number of detections (`ndet`) and first detection date (`firstmjd`)\n- `probability` table: For asteroid classification probability\n- `ss_ztf` table: For Solar System object distance information\n- `detection` table: For filter identifier and detection date information\n\n## Step 3: Filter Objects with More Than 500 Detections\nStart with the `object` table to filter objects with more than 500 detections:\n- Use the condition `object.ndet > 500`\n- This will be our base set of objects\n\n## Step 4: Filter Objects Classified as Asteroids with High Probability\nJoin the filtered objects with the `probability` table to find those classified as asteroids:\n- Join condition: `object.oid = probability.oid`\n- Filter conditions:\n  - `probability.class_name = 'asteroid'`\n  - `probability.classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`\n  - `probability.classifier_version = 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'`\n  - `probability.probability > 0.5`\n\n## Step 5: Filter Objects Close to Known Solar System Objects\nJoin the results with the `ss_ztf` table to find objects close to known Solar System objects:\n- Join condition: `object.oid = ss_ztf.oid`\n- Filter condition: `ss_ztf.ssdistnr < 2` (assuming ssdistnr is in arcseconds)\n\n## Step 6: Join with Detection Table for Additional Information\nJoin with the `detection` table to get filter identifier and detection date information:\n- Join condition: `object.oid = detection.oid`\n- This will allow us to retrieve the required detection-specific information\n\n## Step 7: Select the Required Columns\nSelect the following columns from the joined tables:\n- `object.oid` (ZTF identifier)\n- `object.ndet` (number of detections)\n- `object.firstmjd` (first detection date)\n- `object.lastmjd` (last detection date)\n- `probability.probability` (probability of being an asteroid)\n- `detection.candid` (candidate identifier)\n- `ss_ztf.ssdistnr` (distance between ZTF object and MPC object)\n- `ss_ztf.ssnamenr` (MPC name)\n- `detection.mjd` (detection date)\n- `detection.fid` (filter identifier)\n\n## Step 8: Order and Limit Results\n- Order the results by `object.firstmjd` (first detection date)\n- Limit the results to at most 10 objects using `LIMIT 10`\n\n## Step 9: Optimize the Query\n- Use appropriate joins (INNER JOIN) to ensure only matching records are returned\n- Consider using subqueries to improve performance, especially when joining with the large `detection` table\n- Use the existing indexes on the tables to speed up the query execution\n\nThis decomposition plan provides a systematic approach to generating the required PostgreSQL query, ensuring all conditions are met and the necessary information is retrieved efficiently.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}]}}}

Use appropriate joins (INNER JOIN) since we need matches in all tables\n2. Apply filters early in the query to reduce the dataset size\n3. Use the existing indexes on the tables, particularly:\n   - `ix_object_ndet` for filtering on `ndet`\n   - `ix_probabilities_oid` for joining with `probability`\n   - `ix_ss_ztf_candid` for joining with `ss_ztf`\n   - `ix_ndetection_oid` for joining with `detection`\n\nThis approach ensures we retrieve the exact information requested while maintaining query efficiency by leveraging the database's structure and indexes.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}]}}}

The goal is to combine data from three different tables into a single output with specific columns.\n\n## Step 1: Identify the Required Tables and Columns\nWe need to retrieve data from three tables:\n- `detection` - Contains detection data\n- `non_detection` - Contains non-detection data\n- `forced_photometry` - Contains forced photometry data\n\n## Step 2: Determine Common and Table-Specific Columns\nFor each table, identify the columns that match the requested output:\n\n### Common columns across tables:\n- ZTF identifier (oid)\n- Epoch date (mjd)\n- Filter identifier (fid)\n\n### Table-specific columns:\n- From `detection`:\n  - isdiffpos\n  - magpsf (detection difference magnitude)\n  - sigmapsf (uncertainty of detection difference magnitude)\n  - diffmaglim (5-sigma magnitude limit)\n\n- From `non_detection`:\n  - No isdiffpos (will be NULL)\n  - No detection magnitude (will be NULL)\n  - No uncertainty (will be NULL)\n  - diffmaglim (5-sigma magnitude limit)\n\n- From `forced_photometry`:\n  - isdiffpos\n  - mag (forced difference magnitude)\n  - e_mag (uncertainty of forced difference magnitude)\n  - diffmaglim (5-sigma magnitude limit)\n\n## Step 3: Plan the UNION Query Structure\nWe'll need to use UNION ALL to combine results from all three tables. For each table:\n1. Select the required columns\n2. Add a literal string column named 'table' to indicate the source table\n3. For columns that don't exist in a particular table, use NULL values\n\n## Step 4: Filter for the Specific Object\nFor each subquery, add a WHERE clause to filter for the object 'ZTF24aamtvxb'\n\n## Step 5: Handle Column Type Consistency\nEnsure that corresponding columns in each subquery have compatible data types for the UNION operation. This is particularly important for:\n- isdiffpos (INTEGER in detection and forced_photometry)\n- Magnitude and uncertainty columns (DOUBLE PRECISION)\n\n## Step 6: Order the Results\nAdd an ORDER BY clause to sort the combined results by mjd (epoch date) to present the data in chronological order\n\n## Step 7: Final Query Structure\nThe final query will consist of:\n1. First subquery for detection data\n2. UNION ALL\n3. Second subquery for non-detection data\n4. UNION ALL\n5. Third subquery for forced photometry data\n6. ORDER BY mjd\n\nThis approach will create a single output table containing all epochs from the three source tables, with the requested columns and a 'table' column indicating the origin of each row.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

Objects must have more than 10 detections (`object.ndet > 10`)\n2. Objects must have a probability > 0.7 of being 'bogus' in the 'stamp_classifier' with version 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'\n3. Objects must have a probability > 0.9 of being 'Transient' in the 'lc_classifier_top'\n\n## Step 3: Plan the Join Strategy\n- We need to join the `object` table with the `probability` table twice:\n  - First join to get the stamp classifier probabilities for 'bogus' class\n  - Second join to get the light curve classifier probabilities for 'Transient' class\n- Since we need objects that satisfy both probability conditions, we should use inner joins\n\n## Step 4: Select the Required Columns\n- From `object` table: `oid` (ZTF identifier), `ndet` (number of detections), `firstmjd` (first detection date)\n- From first `probability` join: probability value (to be aliased as 'prob_stamp_bogus')\n- From second `probability` join: probability value (to be aliased as 'prob_lc_transient')\n\n## Step 5: Define the Order and Limit\n- Order the results by the ZTF identifier (`oid`)\n- Limit the results to at most 30 objects\n\n## Step 6: Optimize the Query\n- Use appropriate filtering in the JOIN conditions to reduce the dataset size early\n- Apply the ranking = 1 condition to get only the most likely probabilities\n- Use specific classifier versions as specified in the requirements\n\n## Step 7: Structure the Final Query\n- Start with the `object` table\n- Join with `probability` table for stamp classifier bogus probabilities\n- Join with `probability` table again for light curve classifier transient probabilities\n- Apply all filtering conditions\n- Select and alias the required columns\n- Order by ZTF identifier\n- Limit to 30 results\n\nThis approach will ensure we retrieve the exact data requested while maintaining query performance by applying filters early in the process.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}]}}}

For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}]}}}

For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}]}}}
