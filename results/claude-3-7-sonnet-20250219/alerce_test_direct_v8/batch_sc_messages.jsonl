This database serves as a repository for information about individual spatial objects, encompassing various statistics, properties, detections, and features observed by survey telescopes.\nThe tables within the database are categorized into three types: time and band independent (e.g., object, probability), time-independent (e.g., magstats), and time and band-dependent (e.g., detection). Your role involves carefully analyzing user requests, considering the specifics of the given tables. It is crucial to pay attention to explicit conditions outlined by the user and always maintain awareness of the broader context.\nThe user values the personality of a knowledgeable SQL expert, so ensuring accuracy is paramount. Be thorough in understanding and addressing the user's request, taking into account both explicit conditions and the overall context for effective communication and assistance.\n\n\n# Correct a SQL query given the next user request:\nGet all the objects classified as AGN with a probability larger than 0.6, with light curves covering at least one year that have at least 20 detections at least in one band, and select those that show variations larger than 1 magnitude in the g band and larger than 0.5 in the r band. The magnitudes need to be the corrected ones. Return their oid, the value, name, version and filter id from the features, mean coordinates, number of detections, maximum and minimum magnitudes, the variations in bands as the difference between the maximum and minimum magnitudes aliasing the column as 'delta_mag'. For the filter id columns, use the alias '[table_name]_fid' using the table name as the alias.\n\n# These are the table schemas.

This database serves as a repository for information about individual spatial objects, encompassing various statistics, properties, detections, and features observed by survey telescopes.\nThe tables within the database are categorized into three types: time and band independent (e.g., object, probability), time-independent (e.g., magstats), and time and band-dependent (e.g., detection). Your role involves carefully analyzing user requests, considering the specifics of the given tables. It is crucial to pay attention to explicit conditions outlined by the user and always maintain awareness of the broader context.\nThe user values the personality of a knowledgeable SQL expert, so ensuring accuracy is paramount. Be thorough in understanding and addressing the user's request, taking into account both explicit conditions and the overall context for effective communication and assistance.\n\n\n# Correct a SQL query given the next user request:\nGet all the objects classified as AGN with a probability larger than 0.6, with light curves covering at least one year that have at least 20 detections at least in one band, and select those that show variations larger than 1 magnitude in the g band and larger than 0.5 in the r band. The magnitudes need to be the corrected ones. Return their oid, the value, name, version and filter id from the features, mean coordinates, number of detections, maximum and minimum magnitudes, the variations in bands as the difference between the maximum and minimum magnitudes aliasing the column as 'delta_mag'. For the filter id columns, use the alias '[table_name]_fid' using the table name as the alias.\n\n# These are the table schemas.

This database serves as a repository for information about individual spatial objects, encompassing various statistics, properties, detections, and features observed by survey telescopes.\nThe tables within the database are categorized into three types: time and band independent (e.g., object, probability), time-independent (e.g., magstats), and time and band-dependent (e.g., detection). Your role involves carefully analyzing user requests, considering the specifics of the given tables. It is crucial to pay attention to explicit conditions outlined by the user and always maintain awareness of the broader context.\nThe user values the personality of a knowledgeable SQL expert, so ensuring accuracy is paramount. Be thorough in understanding and addressing the user's request, taking into account both explicit conditions and the overall context for effective communication and assistance.\n\n\n# Correct a SQL query given the next user request:\nGet all the objects classified as AGN with a probability larger than 0.6, with light curves covering at least one year that have at least 20 detections at least in one band, and select those that show variations larger than 1 magnitude in the g band and larger than 0.5 in the r band.

It is possible that the query is too complex and it is necessary to use nested queries to optimize the query.\n    - If there is a JOIN or a sub-query between some table and probability, check if the condition 'ranking=1' is set in the probability table, unless the request said otherwise.\n- If there are conditions involving dates or times, check if the dates are not too far away, or are in a reasonable range.\n# If the probability table is used, use always the next conditions, unless the user explicitly specifies different probability conditions.\n- Ensure there are at least 3 conditions on the probability table, because if not, the query is too general.
