this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier'\n### IF THE 'feature' TABLE is used with 2 or more features, you need to take the following steps, because it is a transposed table (each feature is in a different row).\nI. Create a sub-query using the 'probability' TABLE filtering the desired objects.\nII. For each feature, you have to make a sub-query retrieving the specific feature adding the condition of its value, taking only the oids in the 'probability' sub-query with an INNER JOIN inside each 'feature' sub-query to retrieve only the features associated with the desired spatial objects.\nIII. Make an UNION between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nIV. Make an INTERSECT between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nV. Filter the 'UNION' query from step III selecting only the 'oids' that are in the 'INTERSECT' query from step IV\nVI. Add the remaining conditions to the final result of step V, using the 'probability' sub-query from step I.\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\n**Decomposition Plan for the User Request:**\n\n**Goal:**  \nReturn all objects classified as AGN (Active Galactic Nuclei) that show variability in the r band, but have no detections or show no variability in the g band. Order the features by their value in ascending order, and the final query by oid.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Identify AGN Objects**\n\n- Use the `probability` table to select objects (`oid`) classified as 'AGN'.\n- Apply the default conditions:\n  - `probability.ranking = 1`\n  - `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`\n  - `probability.class_name = 'AGN'`\n- This subquery will provide the list of oids for AGN objects.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Define Variability in the r Band**\n\n- Use the `feature` table to identify objects that show variability in the r band.\n- Variability can be inferred from features such as:\n  - `Std` (standard deviation of the light curve)\n  - `ExcessVar` (intrinsic variability amplitude)\n  - `Amplitude` (half the difference between the median of the maximum 5% and minimum 5% magnitudes)\n- For the r band, `fid = 2`.\n- Select oids from the AGN subquery (from step 1) that have a significant value in at least one of these features in the r band.\n- Define \"show variability\" as having a non-zero or above-threshold value for at least one of these features (e.g., `Std > 0`, `ExcessVar > 0`, or `Amplitude > 0`).\n- Create a subquery for each feature (Std, ExcessVar, Amplitude) in the r band, filtering for oids in the AGN subquery and the feature value > 0.\n- UNION these subqueries to get all oids that show variability in the r band.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Define No Detections or No Variability in the g Band**\n\n- For the g band, `fid = 1`.\n- \"No detections\" means the object does not have any feature rows with `fid = 1` in the `feature` table.\n- \"No variability\" means that, if there are detections (i.e., feature rows with `fid = 1`), the variability features (`Std`, `ExcessVar`, `Amplitude`) are zero or below a minimal threshold.\n- Create two subqueries:\n  - **No Detections:** Select oids from the AGN subquery that do NOT appear in the `feature` table with `fid = 1`.\n  - **No Variability:** Select oids from the AGN subquery that have feature rows with `fid = 1` and all variability features (`Std`, `ExcessVar`, `Amplitude`) are zero or below threshold.\n- UNION these two subqueries to get all oids that either have no detections or show no variability in the g band.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Combine r Band Variability and g Band Non-Variability/No Detections**\n\n- INTERSECT the oids from step 2 (r band variability) with the oids from step 3 (g band no detections or no variability).\n- This gives the set of AGN objects that show variability in the r band but not in the g band.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Retrieve and Order Features**\n\n- For the resulting oids from step 4, retrieve all their features from the `feature` table.\n- Order the features by their `value` in ascending order.\n- Order the final result by `oid`.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Summary of Subqueries and Operations**\n\n- **Subquery 1:** AGN oids from `probability` table (with default conditions).\n- **Subquery 2:** r band variability oids (from `feature` table, `fid = 2`, variability features > 0, INNER JOIN with Subquery 1).\n- **Subquery 3a:** g band no detections oids (oids from Subquery 1 not present in `feature` table with `fid = 1`).\n- **Subquery 3b:** g band no variability oids (oids from Subquery 1 with `fid = 1` and all variability features <= 0).\n- **Subquery 3:** UNION of 3a and 3b.\n- **Subquery 4:** INTERSECT of Subquery 2 and Subquery 3.\n- **Final Query:** Retrieve all features for oids in Subquery 4, order by `value` ascending, then by `oid`.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Joins and Filtering**\n\n- Use INNER JOINs between `probability` and `feature` tables as needed.\n- Use UNION and INTERSECT to combine and filter oids according to the logic above.\n- Ensure all filtering is done using the exact column and table names as per the schema.\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Output Columns**\n\n- If the user does not specify explicit columns, select all columns from the `feature` table for the final set of oids.\n\n---\n\n**End of Decomposition Plan.**\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Return the objects classified as AGN that show variability in the r band, but have no detections or show no variability in the g band.

Create a sub-query using the 'probability' TABLE filtering the desired objects.\nII. For each feature, you have to make a sub-query retrieving the specific feature adding the condition of its value, taking only the oids in the 'probability' sub-query with an INNER JOIN inside each 'feature' sub-query to retrieve only the features associated with the desired spatial objects.\nIII. Make an UNION between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nIV. Make an INTERSECT between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nV. Filter the 'UNION' query from step III selecting only the 'oids' that are in the 'INTERSECT' query from step IV\nVI. Add the remaining conditions to the final result of step V, using the 'probability' sub-query from step I.\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nHere is a detailed decomposition plan for generating the required PostgreSQL query, following the database schema, context, and advanced query requirements:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Identify AGN-classified Objects**\n- Use the `probability` table to select objects classified as 'AGN'.\n- Apply the default conditions: `probability.ranking = 1` and `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`.\n- Retrieve the `oid` of these objects.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Determine Variability in the r Band**\n- Define \"variability\" in the r band. Since the user did not specify a metric, use a standard variability feature, such as `Std` (standard deviation of the light curve), `ExcessVar`, or `Amplitude` in the r band (`fid = 2`).\n- Create a subquery on the `feature` table to select oids (from step 1) where the chosen variability feature in the r band (`fid = 2`) is above a certain threshold (e.g., `Std > 0`, or another reasonable threshold if specified).\n- INNER JOIN this subquery with the AGN oids from step 1 to ensure only AGN-classified objects are considered.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Filter Objects with No Detections or No Variability in the g Band**\n- For \"no detections in the g band\":\n  - Use the `detection` table to check for the absence of detections with `fid = 1` for each oid.\n  - Use a NOT EXISTS or LEFT JOIN ... IS NULL construct to exclude oids with any detection in the g band.\n- For \"no variability in the g band\":\n  - Use the `feature` table to check for the same variability feature (e.g., `Std`, `ExcessVar`, or `Amplitude`) in the g band (`fid = 1`).\n  - Define \"no variability\" as the feature value being zero or below a low threshold (e.g., `Std <= 0`).\n  - Include oids that either have no detection in the g band or have the variability feature below the threshold.\n- Combine these two conditions using a UNION (for oids with no g-band detections) and a subquery for oids with low variability in the g band.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Combine r-band Variability and g-band Non-variability/No Detection**\n- INTERSECT the set of oids from step 2 (r-band variable AGN) with the set from step 3 (no g-band detection or no g-band variability).\n- This ensures only AGN objects that are variable in r but not in g (or undetected in g) are selected.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Retrieve and Order Features**\n- For each selected oid, retrieve all features from the `feature` table.\n- Order the features for each oid by their `value` in ascending order.\n- Order the final result set by `oid` in ascending order.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Detailed Subquery and Join Structure**\n- **Subquery 1:** Select oids from `probability` where class is 'AGN', ranking = 1, classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'.\n- **Subquery 2:** From `feature`, select oids (from Subquery 1) with r-band (`fid = 2`) variability feature above threshold.\n- **Subquery 3a:** From `detection`, select oids (from Subquery 1) with no g-band (`fid = 1`) detections.\n- **Subquery 3b:** From `feature`, select oids (from Subquery 1) with g-band (`fid = 1`) variability feature below or equal to threshold.\n- **Subquery 3:** UNION of Subquery 3a and Subquery 3b to get oids with no g-band detection or no g-band variability.\n- **Subquery 4:** INTERSECT oids from Subquery 2 and Subquery 3.\n- **Final Query:** For oids from Subquery 4, select all features from `feature`, order by `oid` and `value` ascending.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Summary of Steps**\n1. Select AGN-classified oids (probability table, ranking=1, classifier_name='lc_classifier').\n2. Filter for r-band variability (feature table, fid=2, variability feature > threshold).\n3. Identify oids with no g-band detection (detection table, fid=1) or no g-band variability (feature table, fid=1, variability feature <= threshold).\n4. Combine r-band variable and g-band non-variable/no-detection oids (INTERSECT).\n5. Retrieve all features for these oids, order by feature value ascending, then by oid.\n\n---\n\nThis plan ensures the query is accurate, efficient, and follows all schema and context requirements, using advanced SQL constructs (JOINs, UNIONs, INTERSECTs, nested queries) as needed.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Return the objects classified as AGN that show variability in the r band, but have no detections or show no variability in the g band.

This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\n**Decomposition Plan for the User Request:**\n\n**Goal:**  \nReturn all objects classified as AGN (Active Galactic Nuclei) that show variability in the r band, but have no detections or show no variability in the g band. Order the features by their value in ascending order, and the final query by oid.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Identify AGN Objects**\n\n- Use the `probability` table to select objects (`oid`) classified as 'AGN'.\n- Apply the default conditions:\n  - `probability.ranking = 1` (most likely class)\n  - `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`\n  - `probability.class_name = 'AGN'`\n- This subquery will provide the list of candidate AGN objects.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Determine Variability in the r Band**\n\n- Use the `feature` table to assess variability in the r band (fid = 2).\n- Select features that indicate variability. Common variability features include:\n  - 'Std' (standard deviation of the light curve)\n  - 'ExcessVar' (intrinsic variability amplitude)\n  - 'Amplitude' (half the difference between the median of the maximum 5% and minimum 5% magnitudes)\n- For each AGN object, check if at least one of these features in the r band (fid = 2) is above a certain threshold (e.g., Std > 0, ExcessVar > 0, Amplitude > 0). If the user does not specify a threshold, use > 0 as a generic indicator of variability.\n- Create a subquery that INNER JOINs the AGN oids from step 1 with the `feature` table, filtering for the r band and the chosen variability features with value > 0.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Check for No Detections or No Variability in the g Band**\n\n- For the same set of AGN oids, check the g band (fid = 1) in the `feature` table.\n- Two possible conditions:\n  - **No detections in g band:** The object has no rows in the `feature` table with fid = 1.\n  - **No variability in g band:** The object has rows in the `feature` table with fid = 1, but all relevant variability features (Std, ExcessVar, Amplitude) are zero or below threshold (e.g., <= 0).\n- Construct a subquery for AGN oids that either:\n  - Do not appear in the `feature` table with fid = 1, or\n  - Appear in the `feature` table with fid = 1, but all relevant variability features are <= 0.\n- This may require a LEFT JOIN or NOT EXISTS/EXCEPT logic to exclude oids with significant variability in the g band.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Combine Conditions for Final Object Selection**\n\n- Intersect the results from steps 2 and 3 to get AGN objects that:\n  - Show variability in the r band (step 2)\n  - Have no detections or no variability in the g band (step 3)\n- Use an INNER JOIN or INTERSECT between the subqueries from steps 2 and 3, ensuring only oids meeting both criteria are selected.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Retrieve and Order Features**\n\n- For the final set of oids, retrieve all their features from the `feature` table.\n- Order the features by their `value` in ascending order.\n- Order the final result by `oid` as requested.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Summary of Subqueries and Joins**\n\n- **Subquery 1:** Select AGN oids from `probability` with default conditions.\n- **Subquery 2:** Select oids from Subquery 1 with r band variability (feature, fid = 2, variability features > 0).\n- **Subquery 3:** Select oids from Subquery 1 with no g band detections or no g band variability (feature, fid = 1, variability features <= 0 or no rows).\n- **Final Selection:** Intersect oids from Subquery 2 and Subquery 3.\n- **Final Output:** For these oids, select all features from `feature`, order by `value` ascending, then by `oid`.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Details to Include in Each Step**\n\n- Use exact table and column names: `probability`, `feature`, `oid`, `class_name`, `classifier_name`, `ranking`, `fid`, `name`, `value`.\n- Use the correct class and classifier names: `'AGN'`, `'lc_classifier'`.\n- Use the correct bandpass identifiers: `fid = 1` for g band, `fid = 2` for r band.\n- Use the correct feature names for variability: `'Std'`, `'ExcessVar'`, `'Amplitude'`.\n- Use INNER JOINs, NOT EXISTS, or EXCEPT as needed for set logic.\n- Ensure ordering: features by `value` ascending, final output by `oid`.\n\n---\n\n**This plan ensures all required logic, table/column names, and advanced SQL constructs (JOIN, INTERSECT, NOT EXISTS, ordering) are included for an optimal and accurate query.**\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

It is crucial to pay attention to explicit conditions outlined by the user and always maintain awareness of the broader context.\nALeRCE processes data from the alert stream of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), so unless a specific catalog is mentioned, the data is from ZTF, including the object, candidate and filter identifiers, and other relevant information.  \nBe thorough in understanding and addressing the user's request, taking into account both explicit conditions and the overall context for effective communication and assistance.\n\n\n# The Database has the following tables that can be used to generate the SQL query:\n\nCREATE TABLE object ( /* this is the most important table.

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier'\n### IF THE 'feature' TABLE is used with 2 or more features, you need to take the following steps, because it is a transposed table (each feature is in a different row).\nI. Create a sub-query using the 'probability' TABLE filtering the desired objects.\nII. For each feature, you have to make a sub-query retrieving the specific feature adding the condition of its value, taking only the oids in the 'probability' sub-query with an INNER JOIN inside each 'feature' sub-query to retrieve only the features associated with the desired spatial objects.\nIII. Make an UNION between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nIV. Make an INTERSECT between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nV. Filter the 'UNION' query from step III selecting only the 'oids' that are in the 'INTERSECT' query from step IV\nVI. Add the remaining conditions to the final result of step V, using the 'probability' sub-query from step I.\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\n**Decomposition Plan for the User Request:**\n\n**Goal:**  \nReturn all objects classified as AGN (Active Galactic Nuclei) that show variability in the r band, but have no detections or show no variability in the g band. Order the features by their value in ascending order, and the final query by oid.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Identify AGN Objects**\n\n- Use the `probability` table to select objects (`oid`) classified as 'AGN'.\n- Apply the default conditions:\n  - `probability.ranking = 1` (most likely class)\n  - `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`\n  - `probability.class_name = 'AGN'`\n- This subquery will provide the list of candidate AGN objects.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Determine Variability in the r Band**\n\n- Use the `feature` table to assess variability in the r band (fid = 2).\n- Select features that indicate variability. Common variability features include:\n  - 'Std' (standard deviation of the light curve)\n  - 'ExcessVar' (intrinsic variability amplitude)\n  - 'Amplitude' (half the difference between the median of the max 5% and min 5% magnitudes)\n- For this query, select objects with a significant value in at least one of these features in the r band (fid = 2). Define \"show variability\" as having a value above a certain threshold (e.g., 'Std' > 0, 'ExcessVar' > 0, or 'Amplitude' > 0).\n- Join this with the AGN subquery from step 1 to ensure only AGN objects are considered.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Exclude Objects with Detections or Variability in the g Band**\n\n- For the same set of AGN objects, check the `feature` table for the g band (fid = 1).\n- \"No detections\" in the g band can be interpreted as the absence of any feature rows for fid = 1 for that oid.\n- \"Show no variability\" in the g band can be interpreted as all relevant variability features ('Std', 'ExcessVar', 'Amplitude') being zero or NULL.\n- Construct a subquery to find oids that either:\n  - Have no rows in `feature` for fid = 1, or\n  - Have all relevant variability features in g band (fid = 1) with value = 0 or NULL.\n- Exclude any AGN objects that do not meet these criteria.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Combine Criteria**\n\n- Intersect the list of AGN objects with r-band variability (from step 2) with the list of AGN objects with no g-band detections or variability (from step 3).\n- This will yield the final set of oids that satisfy all conditions.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Retrieve and Order Features**\n\n- For the resulting oids, retrieve all features from the `feature` table (or a subset if only variability features are needed).\n- Order the features by their `value` in ascending order.\n- Order the final result set by `oid` as requested.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Detailed Subquery and Join Structure**\n\n- **Subquery 1:** Select oids from `probability` where class is 'AGN', ranking = 1, classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'.\n- **Subquery 2:** From `feature`, select oids (from Subquery 1) with fid = 2 and at least one variability feature ('Std', 'ExcessVar', 'Amplitude') > 0.\n- **Subquery 3:** From `feature`, for oids in Subquery 1, check for fid = 1:\n  - If no rows exist for oid and fid = 1, include the oid.\n  - If rows exist, ensure all relevant variability features ('Std', 'ExcessVar', 'Amplitude') are 0 or NULL.\n- **Final Selection:** Intersect oids from Subquery 2 and Subquery 3.\n- **Feature Retrieval:** For these oids, select all features from `feature`, order by `value` ascending, then by `oid`.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Summary of Steps**\n\n1. Select AGN objects using the `probability` table with default conditions.\n2. Filter these objects for r-band variability using the `feature` table and appropriate variability features (fid = 2, value > 0).\n3. Exclude objects with g-band detections or variability (fid = 1, either no rows or all relevant features = 0/NULL).\n4. Intersect the results to get oids meeting all criteria.\n5. Retrieve all features for these oids, order by feature value ascending, and by oid.\n\n---\n\n**Note:**  \n- The query will require multiple subqueries, INNER JOINs, and set operations (INTERSECT, possibly UNION for the g-band logic).\n- The use of the transposed `feature` table requires careful handling to ensure correct filtering and joining.\n- All table and column names must be used exactly as in the schema.  \n- If the user wants all features, select all columns from the `feature` table; otherwise, specify the required features.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Return the objects classified as AGN that show variability in the r band, but have no detections or show no variability in the g band.

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier'\n### IF THE 'feature' TABLE is used with 2 or more features, you need to take the following steps, because it is a transposed table (each feature is in a different row).\nI. Create a sub-query using the 'probability' TABLE filtering the desired objects.\nII. For each feature, you have to make a sub-query retrieving the specific feature adding the condition of its value, taking only the oids in the 'probability' sub-query with an INNER JOIN inside each 'feature' sub-query to retrieve only the features associated with the desired spatial objects.\nIII. Make an UNION between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nIV. Make an INTERSECT between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nV. Filter the 'UNION' query from step III selecting only the 'oids' that are in the 'INTERSECT' query from step IV\nVI. Add the remaining conditions to the final result of step V, using the 'probability' sub-query from step I.\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\n**Decomposition Plan for the Query:**\n\n### 1. **Identify AGN Objects with High Classification Probability**\n   - Start by querying the `probability` table to select objects (`oid`) classified as 'AGN' by the 'lc_classifier' with `ranking = 1` and `probability > 0.6`.\n   - This subquery will provide the set of candidate oids for further filtering.\n\n### 2. **Filter Objects with Light Curves Covering at Least One Year**\n   - Join the oids from step 1 with the `object` table.\n   - Apply the condition: `deltajd >= 365` (since deltajd is the time difference in days between last and first detection).\n   - This ensures the light curve covers at least one year.\n\n### 3. **Filter Objects with at Least 20 Detections in at Least One Band**\n   - For each oid from step 2, check the `feature` table for the feature `n_det` (number of detections) in any band (`fid`).\n   - The feature value must be `>= 20`.\n   - This requires a subquery on the `feature` table, filtered by `name = 'n_det'` and `value >= 20`, and joined with the oids from step 2.\n   - Only retain oids that satisfy this condition in at least one band.\n\n### 4. **Filter Objects with Sufficient Magnitude Variation in g and r Bands**\n   - For the oids from step 3, check the `feature` table for:\n     - `delta_mag_fid` in the g band (`fid = 1`) with `value > 1` (variation > 1 mag in g).\n     - `delta_mag_fid` in the r band (`fid = 2`) with `value > 0.5` (variation > 0.5 mag in r).\n   - Since the `feature` table is transposed, create two subqueries:\n     - One for `delta_mag_fid` with `fid = 1` and `value > 1`.\n     - One for `delta_mag_fid` with `fid = 2` and `value > 0.5`.\n   - Both subqueries should be INNER JOINed with the oids from step 3.\n   - Use INTERSECT to retain only oids present in both subqueries (i.e., objects that meet both variation criteria).\n\n### 5. **Retrieve Required Feature Information**\n   - For the oids from step 4, retrieve all features from the `feature` table:\n     - Select `oid`, `name`, `value`, `version`, and `fid` (aliased as `feature_fid`).\n   - This can be done by joining the filtered oids with the `feature` table.\n\n### 6. **Retrieve Mean Coordinates and Number of Detections**\n   - For the same oids, retrieve from the `object` table:\n     - `meanra`, `meandec`, and `ndet`.\n\n### 7. **Retrieve Maximum and Minimum Magnitudes in g and r Bands (Corrected)**\n   - For each oid, use the `feature` table to get:\n     - `min_mag` and `max_mag` for `fid = 1` (g band) and `fid = 2` (r band).\n     - Ensure these are the corrected magnitudes (the feature names are `min_mag` and `max_mag`, and the corrected values are used if the object is corrected; if not, use the available values).\n   - Retrieve `value`, `fid` (aliased as `feature_fid`), and `version` for each.\n\n### 8. **Calculate Magnitude Variations (delta_mag) in g and r Bands**\n   - For each oid, calculate `delta_mag` in each band as the difference between `max_mag` and `min_mag` for `fid = 1` and `fid = 2`.\n   - Alias the result as `delta_mag`.\n   - This can be done in a subquery or as a computed column in the SELECT statement.\n\n### 9. **Assemble the Final Output**\n   - Combine all the above information:\n     - `oid`\n     - `name`, `value`, `version`, `feature_fid` (from `feature`)\n     - `meanra`, `meandec`, `ndet` (from `object`)\n     - `max_mag`, `min_mag`, `delta_mag` for g and r bands (from `feature` and computed columns)\n   - Ensure that for each oid, all required information is present and columns are properly aliased.\n\n### 10. **Summary of Joins and Subqueries**\n   - Use subqueries and INNER JOINs to filter oids at each step.\n   - Use INTERSECT to enforce that both g and r band variation criteria are met.\n   - Use UNION if needed to combine feature rows for different features.\n   - Ensure all joins are on `oid` and that only oids passing all filters are included in the final result.\n\n### 11. **Final Output Columns and Aliasing**\n   - Ensure the following columns are in the output, with correct aliases:\n     - `oid`\n     - `name` (from `feature`)\n     - `value` (from `feature`)\n     - `version` (from `feature`)\n     - `feature_fid` (from `feature`)\n     - `meanra` (from `object`)\n     - `meandec` (from `object`)\n     - `ndet` (from `object`)\n     - `max_mag` (from `feature`, for each band)\n     - `min_mag` (from `feature`, for each band)\n     - `delta_mag` (computed for each band)\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe query requires a sequence of subqueries and joins:  \n- Start with AGN objects with high probability,  \n- Filter for light curve duration and detection count,  \n- Apply magnitude variation criteria in both g and r bands using INTERSECT,  \n- Retrieve all required features and statistics,  \n- Compute and alias the magnitude variations,  \n- Assemble the final output with all requested columns and aliases.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Get all the objects classified as AGN with a probability larger than 0.6, with light curves covering at least one year that have at least 20 detections at least in one band, and select those that show variations larger than 1 magnitude in the g band and larger than 0.5 in the r band.

Use the `probability` table.\n   - Apply the following filters:\n     - `class_name = 'AGN'`\n     - `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`\n     - `ranking = 1` (default condition)\n     - `probability > 0.6`\n   - Select only the `oid` column for further filtering.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Filter Objects with Light Curves Covering at Least One Year**\n   - Use the `object` table.\n   - The time coverage is given by `deltajd` (difference between last and first detection).\n   - Filter for `deltajd >= 365.0`.\n   - Join with the filtered oids from Step 1.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Filter Objects with at Least 20 Detections in at Least One Band**\n   - Use the `feature` table.\n   - The feature name for number of detections is `n_det`.\n   - For each band (g: `fid=1`, r: `fid=2`, i: `fid=3`), check if `value >= 20`.\n   - Only one band needs to satisfy this condition.\n   - Join with the oids from Step 2.\n   - Use a subquery to select oids where at least one row with `name='n_det'` and `value >= 20` exists for the oid.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Filter Objects with Required Magnitude Variations in g and r Bands (Corrected)**\n   - Use the `feature` table.\n   - For the g band (`fid=1`):\n     - Get `min_mag` and `max_mag` where `name='min_mag'` and `name='max_mag'` and `fid=1`.\n     - Compute `delta_mag_g = max_mag - min_mag` for g band.\n     - Require `delta_mag_g > 1.0`.\n   - For the r band (`fid=2`):\n     - Get `min_mag` and `max_mag` where `name='min_mag'` and `name='max_mag'` and `fid=2`.\n     - Compute `delta_mag_r = max_mag - min_mag` for r band.\n     - Require `delta_mag_r > 0.5`.\n   - Both conditions must be satisfied for the same oid.\n   - Use the default feature version unless specified.\n   - Join with the oids from Step 3.\n   - Since the `feature` table is transposed, use the prescribed method:\n     - For each feature (g band delta, r band delta), create a subquery with the required condition and INNER JOIN with the oids from Step 3.\n     - INTERSECT the subqueries for g and r bands to get oids satisfying both.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Retrieve All Required Output Columns**\n   - For the final set of oids from Step 4, retrieve:\n     - From `object`:\n       - `oid`\n       - `meanra`\n       - `meandec`\n       - `ndet`\n     - From `feature`:\n       - `name`\n       - `value`\n       - `version`\n       - `fid` (alias as `feature_fid`)\n       - For `min_mag` and `max_mag` in g and r bands, retrieve their values and fids.\n       - Compute `delta_mag` for each band as `max_mag - min_mag`, alias as `delta_mag`.\n   - Join the `object` and `feature` tables on `oid`.\n   - For each oid, include all features (not just those used for filtering), as requested.\n   - For the filter id columns, use the alias `feature_fid`.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Assemble the Final Output**\n   - Ensure the output includes:\n     - `oid`\n     - `name` (from feature)\n     - `value` (from feature)\n     - `version` (from feature)\n     - `feature_fid` (from feature)\n     - `meanra` (from object)\n     - `meandec` (from object)\n     - `ndet` (from object)\n     - `min_mag` and `max_mag` for g and r bands (from feature)\n     - `delta_mag` for g and r bands (computed as `max_mag - min_mag` for each band)\n   - If needed, use subqueries or CTEs to compute `delta_mag` and join them to the main result.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Summary of Query Structure**\n   - Start with a CTE/subquery for oids classified as AGN with probability > 0.6.\n   - Join with `object` to filter by time coverage.\n   - Join with `feature` to filter by number of detections in any band.\n   - Use subqueries for `min_mag` and `max_mag` in g and r bands, compute `delta_mag` for each, and filter by the required thresholds.\n   - INTERSECT the oids from the g and r band delta_mag subqueries.\n   - For the final oids, join with `object` and `feature` to retrieve all required columns, including all features for each oid.\n   - Alias the filter id columns as `feature_fid`.\n   - Compute and alias the magnitude variations as `delta_mag` for each band.\n\n---\n\nThis step-by-step plan ensures all conditions are met, the correct tables and columns are used, and the output matches the user\u2019s requirements, following the database schema and best practices for handling the transposed `feature` table.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Get all the objects classified as AGN with a probability larger than 0.6, with light curves covering at least one year that have at least 20 detections at least in one band, and select those that show variations larger than 1 magnitude in the g band and larger than 0.5 in the r band.

Use the `probability` table to select objects (`oid`) where:\n    - `class_name = 'AGN'`\n    - `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`\n    - `ranking = 1`\n    - `probability > 0.6`\n  - This subquery will yield the set of oids that are most likely AGN with the required probability.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Filter Objects with Light Curves Covering at Least One Year**\n- **Subquery 2:**  \n  - Use the `object` table to select oids where:\n    - `deltajd >= 365` (since deltajd is the time difference in days between last and first detection)\n  - This subquery will yield oids with at least one year of light curve coverage.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Filter Objects with at Least 20 Detections in at Least One Band**\n- **Subquery 3:**  \n  - Use the `feature` table to select oids where:\n    - `name = 'n_det'`\n    - `value >= 20`\n    - This must be true for at least one band (`fid`).\n  - The subquery should return oids, the corresponding `fid` (filter id), and the feature version.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Filter Objects with Large Variations in Corrected Magnitudes**\n- **Subquery 4a (g band):**\n  - Use the `feature` table to select oids where:\n    - `name = 'delta_mag_fid'`\n    - `fid = 1` (g band)\n    - `value > 1`\n    - The feature must be based on corrected magnitudes (as per the feature description, delta_mag_fid uses corrected magnitudes if available).\n- **Subquery 4b (r band):**\n  - Use the `feature` table to select oids where:\n    - `name = 'delta_mag_fid'`\n    - `fid = 2` (r band)\n    - `value > 0.5`\n    - The feature must be based on corrected magnitudes.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Combine Feature Filters Using INTERSECT and UNION**\n- **Step 5.1:**  \n  - For each feature filter (from steps 3, 4a, 4b), create a subquery that retrieves oids, value, name, version, and fid, joining with the oids from Subquery 1 (AGN) and Subquery 2 (one year coverage).\n- **Step 5.2:**  \n  - Use UNION to combine the results of the three feature subqueries (n_det, delta_mag_fid for g, delta_mag_fid for r).\n- **Step 5.3:**  \n  - Use INTERSECT to find oids that appear in all three feature subqueries (i.e., objects that satisfy all three feature conditions).\n- **Step 5.4:**  \n  - Filter the UNION result to only include oids present in the INTERSECT result, ensuring all feature conditions are met.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Retrieve Additional Object Information**\n- **Step 6.1:**  \n  - For the filtered oids, join with the `object` table to retrieve:\n    - `meanra`, `meandec` (mean coordinates)\n    - `ndet` (total number of detections)\n- **Step 6.2:**  \n  - For each oid, retrieve from the `feature` table:\n    - `min_mag` and `max_mag` for both g (fid=1) and r (fid=2) bands, using corrected magnitudes.\n    - The difference between `max_mag` and `min_mag` in each band, alias as `delta_mag`.\n    - For each feature, retrieve `value`, `name`, `version`, and `fid` (aliased as `feature_fid`).\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Assemble the Final Output**\n- **Step 7.1:**  \n  - Select and output the following columns:\n    - `oid`\n    - `value`, `name`, `version`, `fid` (as `feature_fid`) from the `feature` table\n    - `meanra`, `meandec`, `ndet` from the `object` table\n    - `min_mag` and `max_mag` for g and r bands, with their respective `fid` (aliased as `feature_fid`)\n    - `delta_mag` for g and r bands (computed as `max_mag - min_mag` for each band)\n- **Step 7.2:**  \n  - Ensure that the output includes only those oids that satisfy all the above conditions.\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Query Structure and Joins**\n- **Step 8.1:**  \n  - Use subqueries and INNER JOINs to combine the filtered oids from the `probability`, `object`, and `feature` tables.\n- **Step 8.2:**  \n  - Use the default conditions for the `probability` table as specified in the context.\n- **Step 8.3:**  \n  - Use the feature table logic for multiple features as described in the context (UNION, INTERSECT, filtering).\n- **Step 8.4:**  \n  - Use appropriate aliases for filter id columns (e.g., `feature_fid`).\n\n---\n\n### 9. **Final Filtering and Output**\n- **Step 9.1:**  \n  - Ensure that only objects meeting all criteria (AGN, probability, time coverage, detection count, magnitude variation in both bands) are included.\n- **Step 9.2:**  \n  - Return all requested columns, with correct aliases and values.\n\n---\n\nThis plan ensures the query is accurate, efficient, and follows all schema and context requirements, including advanced use of JOINs, UNIONs, INTERSECTs, and nested subqueries.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier'\n### IF THE 'feature' TABLE is used with 2 or more features, you need to take the following steps, because it is a transposed table (each feature is in a different row).\nI. Create a sub-query using the 'probability' TABLE filtering the desired objects.\nII. For each feature, you have to make a sub-query retrieving the specific feature adding the condition of its value, taking only the oids in the 'probability' sub-query with an INNER JOIN inside each 'feature' sub-query to retrieve only the features associated with the desired spatial objects.\nIII. Make an UNION between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nIV. Make an INTERSECT between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nV. Filter the 'UNION' query from step III selecting only the 'oids' that are in the 'INTERSECT' query from step IV\nVI. Add the remaining conditions to the final result of step V, using the 'probability' sub-query from step I.\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nHere is a detailed decomposition plan for generating the required PostgreSQL query, following the database schema, context, and advanced query requirements:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Filter Objects Classified as AGN with High Probability**\n   - Use the `probability` table to select objects (`oid`) where:\n     - `class_name = 'AGN'`\n     - `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`\n     - `ranking = 1`\n     - `probability > 0.6`\n   - This forms the initial set of candidate objects.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Filter Objects with Light Curves Covering at Least One Year**\n   - Use the `object` table to ensure that the time span between `mjdstarthist` and `mjdendhist` is at least 365 days.\n   - Join or filter the `oid` from the previous step with the `object` table, applying the condition: `mjdendhist - mjdstarthist >= 365`.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Filter Objects with at Least 20 Detections in at Least One Band**\n   - Use the `feature` table to find, for each `oid` from the previous step, if there exists at least one row where:\n     - `name = 'n_det'`\n     - `value >= 20`\n   - The `fid` column indicates the band (1 = g, 2 = r, 3 = i, etc.).\n   - Only keep `oid`s that satisfy this condition in at least one band.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Filter Objects with Large Variations in g and r Bands (Corrected Magnitudes)**\n   - For the remaining `oid`s, use the `feature` table to check:\n     - For g band (`fid = 1`):\n       - `name = 'delta_mag_fid'`\n       - `value > 1.0`\n     - For r band (`fid = 2`):\n       - `name = 'delta_mag_fid'`\n       - `value > 0.5`\n   - Since the `feature` table is transposed, create subqueries for each feature and band, and use INTERSECT to ensure only `oid`s that satisfy both conditions are selected.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Retrieve Required Feature Information**\n   - For the selected `oid`s, retrieve from the `feature` table:\n     - `oid`\n     - `name`\n     - `value`\n     - `version`\n     - `fid` (alias as `feature_fid`)\n   - This should include all features for the selected objects.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Retrieve Mean Coordinates and Number of Detections**\n   - For the selected `oid`s, retrieve from the `object` table:\n     - `meanra`\n     - `meandec`\n     - `ndet`\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Retrieve Maximum and Minimum Corrected Magnitudes in g and r Bands**\n   - Use the `feature` table to get, for each `oid`:\n     - For g band (`fid = 1`):\n       - `name = 'max_mag'` and `name = 'min_mag'`\n     - For r band (`fid = 2`):\n       - `name = 'max_mag'` and `name = 'min_mag'`\n   - Ensure these are the corrected magnitudes (if there is a distinction in the feature naming).\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Calculate Magnitude Variations (delta_mag) in g and r Bands**\n   - For each band (g and r), calculate `delta_mag` as the difference between `max_mag` and `min_mag` for each `oid` and band.\n   - Alias this column as `delta_mag`.\n\n---\n\n### 9. **Assemble the Final Output**\n   - Combine all the above information into the final result set.\n   - Ensure the following columns are included:\n     - `oid`\n     - `name` (from `feature`)\n     - `value` (from `feature`)\n     - `version` (from `feature`)\n     - `feature_fid` (from `feature`)\n     - `meanra` (from `object`)\n     - `meandec` (from `object`)\n     - `ndet` (from `object`)\n     - `max_mag` (from `feature`, for each band)\n     - `min_mag` (from `feature`, for each band)\n     - `delta_mag` (calculated for each band)\n   - Use appropriate JOINs and subqueries to ensure all conditions are met and all required columns are included.\n\n---\n\n### 10. **Alias Filter ID Columns**\n   - Wherever the filter id (`fid`) is included in the output, alias it as `feature_fid` to distinguish it as required.\n\n---\n\n### 11. **Ensure Optimal Query Structure**\n   - Use subqueries and JOINs as needed, prioritizing INNER JOINs over the `probability` and `object` tables, and then joining with the `feature` table.\n   - Use INTERSECT for the feature-based conditions (steps 3 and 4) to ensure only objects meeting all criteria are selected.\n   - Use UNION if needed to combine feature subqueries before applying the INTERSECT.\n\n---\n\n### 12. **Final Filtering and Output**\n   - Ensure that only objects meeting all the above criteria are included in the final output.\n   - If any additional filtering or ordering is required (e.g., by `oid`), apply it at the end.\n\n---\n\nThis step-by-step plan ensures that all user requirements are met, using the correct tables, columns, and advanced SQL constructs (JOIN, INTERSECT, subqueries, aliasing) as required by the complexity of the request and the database schema.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier'\n### IF THE 'feature' TABLE is used with 2 or more features, you need to take the following steps, because it is a transposed table (each feature is in a different row).\nI. Create a sub-query using the 'probability' TABLE filtering the desired objects.\nII. For each feature, you have to make a sub-query retrieving the specific feature adding the condition of its value, taking only the oids in the 'probability' sub-query with an INNER JOIN inside each 'feature' sub-query to retrieve only the features associated with the desired spatial objects.\nIII. Make an UNION between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nIV. Make an INTERSECT between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nV. Filter the 'UNION' query from step III selecting only the 'oids' that are in the 'INTERSECT' query from step IV\nVI. Add the remaining conditions to the final result of step V, using the 'probability' sub-query from step I.\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\n**Decomposition Plan for the Query:**\n\n1. **Identify AGN Objects with High Classification Probability**\n   - Start by filtering the `probability` table for objects classified as 'AGN' with:\n     - `probability.class_name = 'AGN'`\n     - `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`\n     - `probability.ranking = 1`\n     - `probability.probability > 0.6`\n   - This subquery will yield the set of `oid` for candidate AGN objects.\n\n2. **Filter Objects with Light Curves Covering at Least One Year**\n   - Join the filtered AGN `oid` set with the `object` table.\n   - Apply the condition: `object.deltajd >= 365` (since deltajd is the time difference in days between last and first detection).\n   - Retain only those objects that meet this temporal coverage.\n\n3. **Select Objects with at Least 20 Detections in at Least One Band**\n   - For each AGN object, check the `feature` table for the feature `n_det` (number of detections) in any band (`fid`).\n   - Filter for `feature.value >= 20` where `feature.name = 'n_det'`.\n   - Ensure that the `oid` is present in the AGN set from step 2.\n   - This step ensures that at least one band for the object has 20 or more detections.\n\n4. **Select Objects with Sufficient Variability in g and r Bands (Corrected Magnitudes)**\n   - For each object from step 3, check the `feature` table for:\n     - `delta_mag_fid` (difference between maximum and minimum observed magnitude) in the g band (`fid = 1`) and r band (`fid = 2`).\n     - The feature must be based on corrected magnitudes.\n   - Apply the following conditions:\n     - For g band: `feature.name = 'delta_mag_fid'`, `feature.fid = 1`, `feature.value > 1.0`\n     - For r band: `feature.name = 'delta_mag_fid'`, `feature.fid = 2`, `feature.value > 0.5`\n   - Use the INTERSECT method to ensure that only objects meeting both band variability criteria are selected.\n\n5. **Retrieve Required Feature Information**\n   - For the filtered set of `oid` from step 4, retrieve from the `feature` table:\n     - `oid`, `feature.value`, `feature.name`, `feature.version`, `feature.fid` (aliased as `feature_fid`)\n   - This should include all features for the selected objects.\n\n6. **Retrieve Mean Coordinates and Number of Detections**\n   - For the same set of `oid`, join with the `object` table to get:\n     - `object.meanra`, `object.meandec`, `object.ndet`\n\n7. **Retrieve Maximum and Minimum Magnitudes in g and r Bands (Corrected)**\n   - For each selected `oid`, query the `feature` table for:\n     - `min_mag` and `max_mag` features for g band (`fid = 1`) and r band (`fid = 2`), using corrected magnitudes.\n     - Retrieve their values, `feature.name`, `feature.version`, and `feature.fid` (aliased as `feature_fid`).\n\n8. **Calculate and Alias the Magnitude Variations**\n   - For each band (g and r), calculate `delta_mag` as the difference between the maximum and minimum magnitudes (using the corrected values).\n   - Alias this column as `delta_mag` in the output.\n\n9. **Assemble the Final Output**\n   - Combine all the above information into the final result set.\n   - Ensure the output includes:\n     - `oid`\n     - `feature.value`, `feature.name`, `feature.version`, `feature.fid` (aliased as `feature_fid`)\n     - `object.meanra`, `object.meandec`\n     - `object.ndet`\n     - Maximum and minimum magnitudes for g and r bands (with their respective feature details)\n     - Calculated `delta_mag` for g and r bands\n\n10. **Ensure Proper Use of Aliases and Output Formatting**\n    - Use the alias `feature_fid` for the filter id columns from the `feature` table.\n    - Clearly alias the calculated magnitude differences as `delta_mag`.\n    - Ensure all columns are selected as per the user\u2019s request.\n\n11. **Optimize with Subqueries and Joins**\n    - Use subqueries for each major filtering step (probability, time coverage, detection count, variability).\n    - Use INNER JOINs to combine information from `object` and `feature` tables.\n    - Use INTERSECT to enforce that both g and r band variability conditions are met.\n    - Use UNION if needed to combine feature information for different bands or features.\n\n12. **Final Filtering and Output**\n    - Ensure that only objects meeting all criteria are included in the final output.\n    - Return the complete set of requested columns for each qualifying object.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Get all the objects classified as AGN with a probability larger than 0.6, with light curves covering at least one year that have at least 20 detections at least in one band, and select those that show variations larger than 1 magnitude in the g band and larger than 0.5 in the r band.

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier'\n### IF THE 'feature' TABLE is used with 2 or more features, you need to take the following steps, because it is a transposed table (each feature is in a different row).\nI. Create a sub-query using the 'probability' TABLE filtering the desired objects.\nII. For each feature, you have to make a sub-query retrieving the specific feature adding the condition of its value, taking only the oids in the 'probability' sub-query with an INNER JOIN inside each 'feature' sub-query to retrieve only the features associated with the desired spatial objects.\nIII. Make an UNION between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nIV. Make an INTERSECT between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nV. Filter the 'UNION' query from step III selecting only the 'oids' that are in the 'INTERSECT' query from step IV\nVI. Add the remaining conditions to the final result of step V, using the 'probability' sub-query from step I.\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nHere is a detailed decomposition plan for generating the required PostgreSQL query, step by step, with all necessary details and logic:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Identify the Main Selection Table and Columns**\n- The main table for object identifiers is `object` (column: `oid`).\n- We need to retrieve:\n  - `oid`\n  - Probabilities from the `probability` table for both the `stamp_classifier` (class 'SN') and the `lc_classifier` (light curve classifier).\n  - Non-detections from the `non_detection` table (including `oid`, `fid`, `diffmaglim`, and `mjd`).\n  - Filter ID from `magstat` as `magstat_fid` and the initial rise estimate.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Filter Objects by First Detection Date**\n- Use the `object.firstmjd` column.\n- Only include objects where `firstmjd` is between 60188.0 and 60190.0 (September 1 and 2, inclusive of the first two days).\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Select Objects with Highest Probability for 'SN' in the Stamp Classifier**\n- Use the `probability` table:\n  - Filter for `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'` and `class_name = 'SN'`.\n  - Only include rows where `ranking = 1` (highest probability for that classifier/class).\n- Join this filtered set to the main object selection.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Retrieve Probabilities from the Light Curve Classifier**\n- Use the `probability` table again:\n  - Filter for `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'` and `ranking = 1` (default condition).\n- Join this to the main object selection to get the highest probability for the light curve classifier.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Identify Fast Risers**\n- For each object, in each filter:\n  - Find the first detection in the `detection` table (minimum `mjd` for that `oid` and `fid`).\n  - Find the last non-detection in the `non_detection` table for the same `oid` and `fid`, with `mjd` less than the first detection's `mjd`.\n  - Calculate the time difference (`dt = detection.mjd - non_detection.mjd`).\n  - Calculate the magnitude difference (`dm = non_detection.diffmaglim - detection.magpsf`).\n  - Compute the rate: `dm/dt`.\n  - Only include objects where this rate is at least 0.25 mag/day.\n- This requires a subquery or CTE to:\n  - For each object and filter, get the first detection.\n  - For each first detection, get the last non-detection before it in the same filter.\n  - Calculate the rate and filter for those >= 0.25.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Retrieve Non-Detections for Qualified Objects**\n- For objects passing the above filters, retrieve all their non-detections from the `non_detection` table.\n- Include `oid`, `fid`, `diffmaglim`, and `mjd`.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Retrieve Filter ID and Initial Rise Estimate from magstat**\n- For each object and filter, retrieve from `magstat`:\n  - `fid` as `magstat_fid`\n  - The initial rise estimate, which is `dmdt_first` (rate of magnitude change at detection).\n- Join this to the main selection using `oid` and `fid`.\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Assemble the Final Output Columns**\n- For each qualifying object and filter, output:\n  - `object.oid`\n  - Probability for 'SN' in the stamp classifier (from `probability` table, `classifier_name='stamp_classifier'`, `class_name='SN'`)\n  - Probability for the most likely class in the light curve classifier (from `probability` table, `classifier_name='lc_classifier'`)\n  - All non-detections: `non_detection.oid`, `non_detection.fid`, `non_detection.diffmaglim`, `non_detection.mjd`\n  - `magstat.fid` as `magstat_fid`\n  - `magstat.dmdt_first` as the initial rise estimate\n\n---\n\n### 9. **Order and Limit the Results**\n- Order the results by `oid`.\n- Limit the output to 100 rows.\n\n---\n\n### 10. **Summary of Required Joins and Subqueries**\n- **Subquery/CTE 1:** Select objects with first detection in the first two days of September.\n- **Subquery/CTE 2:** For those objects, select those with highest probability for 'SN' in the stamp classifier.\n- **Subquery/CTE 3:** For those objects, select those that are fast risers (using detection and non_detection tables, as described above).\n- **Join:** For the resulting objects, join to:\n  - `probability` for light curve classifier probabilities.\n  - `non_detection` for all non-detections.\n  - `magstat` for filter ID and initial rise estimate.\n- **Final Selection:** Select and alias the required columns, order by `oid`, and limit to 100 rows.\n\n---\n\n### 11. **Details to Ensure Correctness and Performance**\n- Use INNER JOINs for all required relationships to ensure only qualifying objects are included.\n- Use appropriate WHERE clauses for classifier names, class names, and rankings as per the default and user-specified conditions.\n- Use subqueries or CTEs to efficiently filter for fast risers and to avoid unnecessary large joins.\n- Ensure that the join between detection and non_detection is on both `oid` and `fid` and that the non_detection is before the first detection.\n- Use indexes on `object.firstmjd`, `probability.ranking`, and `probability.classifier_name` for performance.\n\n---\n\nThis plan provides a step-by-step breakdown of the logic, required subqueries, joins, and filtering conditions to generate the optimal and accurate SQL query for the user\u2019s advanced request.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: \n-- mjd date for September 01 = 60188.0\n-- mjd date for September 02 = 60189.0\nDomain Knowledge: \n-- A fast riser is defined as an object whose first detection is brighter by at least a rate of 0.25 magnitudes/day than the last non-detection obtained before the first detection (both first detection and last non-detection are in the same filter)\n\n # User Request: '' Get the object identifiers, probabilities in the stamp classifier and light curves (including only non-detections) for objects whose highest probability in the stamp classifier is obtained for class SN, had their first detection in the first 2 days of september, and qualify as fast risers.

`object`: for general object information and to filter by first detection date.\n  - `probability`: for classification probabilities, specifically for the 'stamp_classifier' and class 'SN'.\n  - `magstat`: for filter ID and initial rise estimate (dmdt_first).\n  - `non_detection`: for non-detection light curve data.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Filter Objects by First Detection Date**\n- Use the `object` table to select objects whose `firstmjd` is between 60188.0 and 60190.0 (to include both September 1 and 2).\n- This will be the initial filter for candidate objects.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Identify Objects with Highest Probability for 'SN' in 'stamp_classifier'**\n- From the `probability` table, select rows where:\n  - `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`\n  - `class_name = 'SN'`\n  - `ranking = 1` (to ensure it is the highest probability class for the object in this classifier)\n- Retrieve the `oid` and the associated `probability` value.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Determine Fast Riser Objects**\n- For each object and each filter (fid), determine if the object is a fast riser:\n  - Join `magstat` for each object and filter, and use the `dmdt_first` column.\n  - A fast riser is defined as `dmdt_first >= 0.25` (since the rate is in magnitudes/day and must be at least 0.25).\n- Only include objects and filters where this condition is met.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Retrieve Non-Detection Light Curve Data**\n- For each qualifying object, retrieve all associated non-detections from the `non_detection` table.\n- For each non-detection, get the `oid`, `fid`, `mjd`, and `diffmaglim`.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Retrieve magstat Filter ID and Initial Rise Estimate**\n- For each qualifying object and filter, retrieve:\n  - `fid` as `magstat_fid`\n  - `dmdt_first` as the initial rise estimate\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Combine All Conditions**\n- The final set of objects must satisfy all of the following:\n  - First detection in the first two days of September (`object.firstmjd` in range)\n  - Highest probability in `stamp_classifier` is for class 'SN'\n  - Qualify as fast risers in at least one filter (`magstat.dmdt_first >= 0.25`)\n- The result should include only non-detection light curve data for these objects.\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Select and Alias Required Columns**\n- For each result row, select:\n  - `object.oid`\n  - `probability.probability` (for 'SN' in 'stamp_classifier')\n  - `non_detection.fid` (filter ID for non-detection)\n  - `non_detection.diffmaglim` (image difference for non-detection)\n  - `magstat.fid` as `magstat_fid`\n  - `magstat.dmdt_first` (initial rise estimate)\n\n---\n\n### 9. **Order and Limit Results**\n- Order the results by `oid`.\n- Limit the output to 100 rows.\n\n---\n\n### 10. **Detailed Subquery and Join Plan**\n- **Step 1:** Create a subquery to select all `oid` from `object` where `firstmjd` is in the required range.\n- **Step 2:** Join this subquery with `probability` to filter for `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`, `class_name = 'SN'`, and `ranking = 1`.\n- **Step 3:** Join the result with `magstat` to filter for `dmdt_first >= 0.25` (fast riser) and retrieve `magstat.fid` and `dmdt_first`.\n- **Step 4:** Join the result with `non_detection` on `oid` and `fid` to retrieve all non-detections for the qualifying objects and filters.\n- **Step 5:** Select and alias the required columns.\n- **Step 6:** Order by `oid` and limit to 100 rows.\n\n---\n\n### 11. **Summary of Required Joins and Filters**\n- INNER JOIN between `object` and `probability` (on `oid`), with the specified classifier/class/ranking.\n- INNER JOIN with `magstat` (on `oid` and `fid`), with `dmdt_first >= 0.25`.\n- INNER JOIN with `non_detection` (on `oid` and `fid`), to get only non-detection data.\n- Apply all WHERE conditions as described above.\n\n---\n\n### 12. **Final Output**\n- The final result will be a table with columns:\n  - `oid`\n  - `probability` (from `probability` table, for 'SN' in 'stamp_classifier')\n  - `fid` (from `non_detection`)\n  - `diffmaglim` (from `non_detection`)\n  - `magstat_fid` (from `magstat.fid`)\n  - `dmdt_first` (from `magstat`, as the initial rise estimate)\n- Ordered by `oid`, limited to 100 rows.\n\n---\n\nThis plan ensures all required conditions and joins are met, and the output matches the user\u2019s request, using the optimal and accurate approach for the ALeRCE schema.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: \n-- mjd date for September 01 = 60188.0\n-- mjd date for September 02 = 60189.0\nDomain Knowledge: \n-- A fast riser is defined as an object whose first detection is brighter by at least a rate of 0.25 magnitudes/day than the last non-detection obtained before the first detection (both first detection and last non-detection are in the same filter)\n\n # User Request: '' Get the object identifiers, probabilities in the stamp classifier and light curves (including only non-detections) for objects whose highest probability in the stamp classifier is obtained for class SN, had their first detection in the first 2 days of september, and qualify as fast risers.

The same `oid`\n  - The same `fid`\n  - `mjd` less than the first detection `mjd`\n- For each, select the non-detection with the maximum `mjd` (i.e., the last non-detection before the first detection).\n- Retrieve the `diffmaglim` (limiting magnitude) and `mjd` for this non-detection.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Calculate the Initial Rise Rate for Each Object**\n\n- For each object, calculate the rise rate as:\n  - (non_detection.diffmaglim - detection.magpsf) / (detection.mjd - non_detection.mjd)\n  - Use the `magpsf` and `mjd` from the first detection, and `diffmaglim` and `mjd` from the last non-detection.\n- Only keep objects where this rise rate is **at least 0.25 magnitudes/day** (i.e., greater than or equal to 0.25).\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Filter Objects by Highest Probability in the Stamp Classifier for Class 'SN'**\n\n- For the remaining `oid`s, use the `probability` table to:\n  - Select entries where `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`\n  - `class_name = 'SN'`\n  - `ranking = 1` (highest probability for this classifier)\n- Retrieve the `probability` value for these entries.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Retrieve Probabilities in the Stamp Classifier and Light Curve Classifier**\n\n- For each qualifying `oid`, retrieve:\n  - The probability for `class_name = 'SN'` and `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'` (already done above).\n  - The probability for `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'` and `ranking = 1` (highest probability class in the light curve classifier).\n- Join these probabilities to the main result set.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Retrieve All Non-Detections for Each Object**\n\n- For each qualifying `oid`, retrieve all rows from the `non_detection` table (i.e., the light curve non-detections).\n- For each, include `oid`, `fid`, `mjd`, and `diffmaglim`.\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Retrieve magstat Information for the First Detection Filter**\n\n- For each qualifying `oid` and the filter ID of the first detection, retrieve the corresponding row from the `magstat` table.\n- Include the `fid` as `magstat_fid` and any other relevant columns (at least for the initial rise estimate).\n\n---\n\n### 9. **Assemble the Final Output Columns**\n\n- For each row, include:\n  - `oid`\n  - Probability in the stamp classifier for class 'SN'\n  - Probability in the light curve classifier (highest probability class)\n  - Filter ID of the non-detection (`fid`)\n  - `diffmaglim` of the non-detection\n  - Filter ID from magstat as `magstat_fid`\n  - The initial rise estimate (the calculated rise rate)\n- Ensure that the results are ordered by `oid`.\n\n---\n\n### 10. **Limit the Results**\n\n- Limit the final result set to 100 rows.\n\n---\n\n### 11. **Summary of Required Joins and Subqueries**\n\n- Subquery 1: Select objects with `firstmjd` in the desired range.\n- Subquery 2: For each object, find the first detection and its filter.\n- Subquery 3: For each object and filter, find the last non-detection before the first detection.\n- Subquery 4: Calculate the rise rate and filter for fast risers.\n- Subquery 5: Join with the `probability` table for the stamp classifier (class 'SN', ranking 1).\n- Subquery 6: Join with the `probability` table for the light curve classifier (ranking 1).\n- Subquery 7: Join with the `non_detection` table to get all non-detections for each object.\n- Subquery 8: Join with the `magstat` table for the first detection filter.\n- Assemble all required columns, order by `oid`, and limit to 100 rows.\n\n---\n\n### 12. **Notes on Query Construction**\n\n- Use INNER JOINs to combine the main object list with detection, non_detection, probability, and magstat tables.\n- Use subqueries or CTEs (WITH clauses) to structure the logic for clarity and efficiency.\n- Ensure all default conditions for the probability table are applied (e.g., `ranking = 1` and correct `classifier_name`).\n- Use explicit column names and aliases as required.\n\n---\n\nThis step-by-step plan ensures that all required conditions, joins, and calculations are performed systematically and efficiently, using the ALeRCE schema and domain knowledge.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier'\n### IF THE 'feature' TABLE is used with 2 or more features, you need to take the following steps, because it is a transposed table (each feature is in a different row).\nI. Create a sub-query using the 'probability' TABLE filtering the desired objects.\nII. For each feature, you have to make a sub-query retrieving the specific feature adding the condition of its value, taking only the oids in the 'probability' sub-query with an INNER JOIN inside each 'feature' sub-query to retrieve only the features associated with the desired spatial objects.\nIII. Make an UNION between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nIV. Make an INTERSECT between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nV. Filter the 'UNION' query from step III selecting only the 'oids' that are in the 'INTERSECT' query from step IV\nVI. Add the remaining conditions to the final result of step V, using the 'probability' sub-query from step I.\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nHere is a detailed decomposition plan for generating the required PostgreSQL query, step by step, with all necessary details and logic:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**\n- **object**: Contains object identifiers (`oid`), and time of first detection (`firstmjd`).\n- **probability**: Contains classification probabilities (`probability`), classifier name (`classifier_name`), class name (`class_name`), ranking (`ranking`), and `oid`.\n- **detection**: Contains detection events, including `oid`, `mjd` (detection time), `fid` (filter ID), and `magpsf` (magnitude).\n- **non_detection**: Contains non-detection events, including `oid`, `fid`, `mjd`, and `diffmaglim` (limiting magnitude).\n- **magstat**: Contains per-object, per-filter statistics, including `oid`, `fid`, and various magnitude statistics.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Filter Objects by First Detection Date**\n- Select objects from the `object` table where `firstmjd` is between 60188.0 and 60190.0 (to include both September 1 and 2).\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Filter by Highest Probability in Stamp Classifier for Class 'SN'**\n- From the `probability` table, select rows where:\n  - `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`\n  - `class_name = 'SN'`\n  - `ranking = 1` (highest probability for this classifier/class)\n- Join this with the filtered objects from step 2 on `oid`.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Identify Fast Risers**\n- For each object and filter:\n  - Find the first detection in the `detection` table (minimum `mjd` for each `oid` and `fid`).\n  - For that detection, find the most recent non-detection in the same filter from the `non_detection` table with `mjd` less than the detection's `mjd`.\n  - Calculate the rate of rise:  \n    \\[(diffmaglim - magpsf) / (detection.mjd - non_detection.mjd)\\]\n    - `magpsf` is the magnitude at first detection.\n    - `diffmaglim` is the limiting magnitude at last non-detection.\n    - The rate must be **\u2265 0.25 mag/day**.\n- Only keep objects (and filter IDs) that meet this criterion.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Retrieve Probabilities in Stamp Classifier and Light Curve Data (Non-Detections)**\n- For the qualifying objects and filter IDs:\n  - Get the probability from the `probability` table for `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`, `class_name = 'SN'`, and `ranking = 1`.\n  - Get all non-detection records from the `non_detection` table for these objects and filter IDs.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Retrieve magstat Information**\n- For each qualifying object and filter ID, retrieve the corresponding row from the `magstat` table:\n  - Get `fid` as `magstat_fid`.\n  - Optionally, retrieve other columns if needed for the initial rise estimate.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Assemble the Final Output Columns**\n- For each qualifying object, filter, and non-detection:\n  - `oid`\n  - `probability` (from `probability` table, stamp classifier, class 'SN')\n  - `fid` (from `non_detection` as filter ID)\n  - `diffmaglim` (from `non_detection`)\n  - `magstat_fid` (from `magstat`)\n  - The initial rise estimate (the calculated rate from step 4)\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Order and Limit Results**\n- Order the results by `oid`.\n- Limit the output to 100 rows.\n\n---\n\n### 9. **Detailed Subquery and Join Plan**\n- **Subquery A**: Filter `object` table for `firstmjd` in the required range.\n- **Subquery B**: Filter `probability` for `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`, `class_name = 'SN'`, `ranking = 1`.\n- **Join 1**: INNER JOIN Subquery A and Subquery B on `oid`.\n- **Subquery C**: For each (`oid`, `fid`), find the first detection (`detection` table, min `mjd`).\n- **Subquery D**: For each (`oid`, `fid`), find the last non-detection before the first detection (`non_detection` table, max `mjd` < detection `mjd`).\n- **Subquery E**: Calculate the rise rate for each (`oid`, `fid`) pair using the results from Subqueries C and D. Filter for rate \u2265 0.25.\n- **Join 2**: INNER JOIN the result of Join 1 with Subquery E on `oid` and `fid`.\n- **Subquery F**: Get all non-detections for qualifying (`oid`, `fid`) pairs from `non_detection`.\n- **Join 3**: INNER JOIN the result of Join 2 with Subquery F on `oid` and `fid`.\n- **Subquery G**: Get `magstat` for qualifying (`oid`, `fid`) pairs.\n- **Join 4**: LEFT JOIN the result of Join 3 with Subquery G on `oid` and `fid` (as `magstat_fid`).\n- **Select**: Choose the required columns for output.\n- **Order and Limit**: Apply `ORDER BY oid` and `LIMIT 100`.\n\n---\n\n### 10. **Summary of Steps**\n1. Filter objects by first detection date.\n2. Filter for highest probability in stamp classifier for class 'SN'.\n3. For each object and filter, find first detection and last non-detection before it.\n4. Calculate rise rate and filter for fast risers.\n5. Retrieve all non-detections for qualifying objects/filters.\n6. Retrieve magstat info for qualifying objects/filters.\n7. Assemble and output the required columns, ordered and limited.\n\n---\n\nThis plan ensures all required conditions, joins, and calculations are performed efficiently and accurately, using the correct tables, columns, and logic as per the schema and user request.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: \n-- mjd date for September 01 = 60188.0\n-- mjd date for September 02 = 60189.0\nDomain Knowledge: \n-- A fast riser is defined as an object whose first detection is brighter by at least a rate of 0.25 magnitudes/day than the last non-detection obtained before the first detection (both first detection and last non-detection are in the same filter)\n\n # User Request: '' Get the object identifiers, probabilities in the stamp classifier and light curves (including only non-detections) for objects whose highest probability in the stamp classifier is obtained for class SN, had their first detection in the first 2 days of september, and qualify as fast risers.

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier' ; this will return the classifications by the light curve classifier\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n# If you need to use 2 tables, try using a INNER JOIN statement, or a sub-query over 'probability' or 'object', if the query requires it. It is important to be really careful with the use of sub-queries or JOINs, as they can slow down the query.\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Answer ONLY with the final SQL query, with the following format: \n  ```sql SQL_QUERY_HERE ```\nDON'T include anything else in your answer. If you want to add comments, use the SQL comment format inside the query.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\n**Decomposition Plan for the User Request:**\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Tables and Columns:**\n   - The required information comes from two tables:\n     - `detection`: Contains `oid` (object identifier), `candid` (candidate identifier), `fid` (filter identifier), `mjd` (modified julian date), `magpsf` (magnitude), `sigmapsf` (magnitude error), `has_stamp` (whether the object has stamps), `drb` (deep learning real bogus score).\n     - `ps1_ztf`: Contains `oid`, `sgscore1` (star galaxy score of the nearest object), `distpsnr1` (distance to the nearest source in panstarrs).\n   - The join key between these tables is `oid` and `candid`.\n\n2. **Filter by List of OIDs:**\n   - Only consider rows where `oid` is in the provided list:\n     - ['ZTF23aavzgjg', 'ZTF23aaynzyk', 'ZTF23aavqxos', 'ZTF23aaknyni', 'ZTF23aavsdtc', 'ZTF18aandkua', 'ZTF23aaxfewt', 'ZTF23aavshwi', 'ZTF22aawasao', 'ZTF23aaxgvnt']\n\n3. **Apply Deep Learning Real Bogus Score Filter:**\n   - Only include detections where `drb > 0.5`.\n\n4. **Apply Star Galaxy Score and Distance Filters:**\n   - Only include results where either:\n     - `sgscore1 < 0.5`\n     - OR `distpsnr1 < 1` (arcsec)\n\n5. **Join the Tables:**\n   - Perform an INNER JOIN between `detection` and `ps1_ztf` on both `oid` and `candid` to ensure the correct association of detection and Pan-STARRS information.\n\n6. **Select the Required Columns:**\n   - From `detection`: `oid`, `candid`, `fid`, `mjd`, `magpsf`, `sigmapsf`, `has_stamp`, `drb`\n   - From `ps1_ztf`: `sgscore1`, `distpsnr1`\n\n7. **Return All Matching Rows:**\n   - No aggregation or grouping is required; return all rows that match the above criteria.\n\n8. **Order of Operations:**\n   - The filtering on `oid` and `drb` should be done as early as possible for efficiency.\n   - The join should be performed after filtering to minimize the number of rows being joined.\n   - The final filter on `sgscore1` and `distpsnr1` should be applied after the join.\n\n9. **Result:**\n   - The output should be a table with the columns: `oid`, `candid`, `fid`, `mjd`, `magpsf`, `sigmapsf`, `has_stamp`, `drb`, `sgscore1`, `distpsnr1`, for all detections matching the specified conditions.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''For the next list of oids: ['ZTF23aavzgjg' 'ZTF23aaynzyk' 'ZTF23aavqxos' 'ZTF23aaknyni'\n 'ZTF23aavsdtc' 'ZTF18aandkua' 'ZTF23aaxfewt' 'ZTF23aavshwi'\n 'ZTF22aawasao' 'ZTF23aaxgvnt'], return the unique object identifier, candidate identifier, filter identifier, modified julian date, magnitud, magnitud error, whether the object has stamps, deep learning real bogus score, the star galaxy score of the nearest object, and the distance to the nearest source in panstarrs for objects that have a deep learning real bogus score greater than 0.5 and that either have a star galaxy score less than 0.5 or a distance to the nearest panstarrs source smaller than 1 arcsec.''"}], "max_completion_tokens": 4000, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "n": 1}}

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier'\n### IF THE 'feature' TABLE is used with 2 or more features, you need to take the following steps, because it is a transposed table (each feature is in a different row).\nI. Create a sub-query using the 'probability' TABLE filtering the desired objects.\nII. For each feature, you have to make a sub-query retrieving the specific feature adding the condition of its value, taking only the oids in the 'probability' sub-query with an INNER JOIN inside each 'feature' sub-query to retrieve only the features associated with the desired spatial objects.\nIII. Make an UNION between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nIV. Make an INTERSECT between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nV. Filter the 'UNION' query from step III selecting only the 'oids' that are in the 'INTERSECT' query from step IV\nVI. Add the remaining conditions to the final result of step V, using the 'probability' sub-query from step I.\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nHere is a detailed decomposition plan for generating the required PostgreSQL query:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**\n   - **object**: Contains the main statistics for each ZTF object (oid is the primary key).\n   - **probability**: Contains classification probabilities for each object (oid, class_name, classifier_name, probability, ranking).\n   - **ps1_ztf**: Contains information about the three closest Pan-STARRS sources for each ZTF object (oid, distpsnr1 for the nearest source distance).\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Define the Selection Criteria**\n   - **Distance to nearest PS1 source**: `ps1_ztf.distpsnr1 > 5` (distance in arcseconds).\n   - **Probability condition**: \n     - Use only the most likely class per object: `probability.ranking = 1`.\n     - Use only the light curve classifier: `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`.\n     - Probability must be greater than 0.7: `probability.probability > 0.7`.\n     - The class must NOT be a supernova. In the context of the 'lc_classifier', supernova classes are: 'SNIa', 'SNIbc', 'SNII', 'SLSN'. So, exclude these: `probability.class_name NOT IN ('SNIa', 'SNIbc', 'SNII', 'SLSN')`.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Determine the Required Output**\n   - Return all columns from the `object`, `probability`, and `ps1_ztf` tables for the selected objects.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Establish Table Relationships and Joins**\n   - All three tables are linked by the `oid` column.\n   - Use INNER JOINs to combine the tables, ensuring only objects present in all three tables and meeting the criteria are returned.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Apply Filtering and Ordering**\n   - Apply the distance and probability/class conditions in the WHERE clause.\n   - Order the results by `ps1_ztf.distpsnr1` (ascending, as the user wants to order by the nearest PS1 source distance).\n   - Limit the results to at most 200 objects.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Detailed Step-by-Step Plan**\n\n#### Step 1: Filter the `probability` Table\n   - Select oids where:\n     - `ranking = 1`\n     - `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`\n     - `probability > 0.7`\n     - `class_name NOT IN ('SNIa', 'SNIbc', 'SNII', 'SLSN')`\n   - This subquery will yield the set of oids that are most likely classified as a non-supernova class with high confidence.\n\n#### Step 2: Join with the `object` Table\n   - INNER JOIN the filtered probability subquery with the `object` table on `oid` to get all object statistics for the selected oids.\n\n#### Step 3: Join with the `ps1_ztf` Table\n   - INNER JOIN the result from Step 2 with the `ps1_ztf` table on `oid`.\n   - Apply the filter `ps1_ztf.distpsnr1 > 5` to ensure the nearest PS1 source is more than 5 arcseconds away.\n\n#### Step 4: Select All Columns\n   - In the SELECT clause, include all columns from `object`, `probability`, and `ps1_ztf`.\n\n#### Step 5: Order and Limit Results\n   - Order the results by `ps1_ztf.distpsnr1` (ascending).\n   - Limit the output to 200 rows.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Summary of Query Structure**\n   - The query will use INNER JOINs between the three tables on `oid`.\n   - The WHERE clause will enforce the probability, class, classifier, and distance conditions.\n   - The SELECT clause will include all columns from the three tables.\n   - The results will be ordered and limited as specified.\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Additional Considerations**\n   - Ensure that if there are multiple entries per oid in `ps1_ztf` (due to different `candid` values), the query logic should be clear whether to select all or just the first/unique per oid. If not specified, return all matching rows.\n   - If performance is a concern, ensure that the relevant indexes (on `oid`, `distpsnr1`, `probability`, etc.) are used.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \n- Filter `probability` for non-supernova, high-probability, most-likely classes from the light curve classifier.\n- Join with `object` and `ps1_ztf` on `oid`.\n- Filter for nearest PS1 source distance > 5 arcsec.\n- Select all columns from all three tables.\n- Order by nearest PS1 source distance.\n- Limit to 200 results.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Find at most 200 ZTF objects that satisfy the following conditions: have a distance to the nearest PS1 source larger than 5 arcsec, and have a probability larger than 0.7 of being in a class other than supernova in the light curve classifier.

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier'\n### IF THE 'feature' TABLE is used with 2 or more features, you need to take the following steps, because it is a transposed table (each feature is in a different row).\nI. Create a sub-query using the 'probability' TABLE filtering the desired objects.\nII. For each feature, you have to make a sub-query retrieving the specific feature adding the condition of its value, taking only the oids in the 'probability' sub-query with an INNER JOIN inside each 'feature' sub-query to retrieve only the features associated with the desired spatial objects.\nIII. Make an UNION between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nIV. Make an INTERSECT between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nV. Filter the 'UNION' query from step III selecting only the 'oids' that are in the 'INTERSECT' query from step IV\nVI. Add the remaining conditions to the final result of step V, using the 'probability' sub-query from step I.\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nHere is a detailed decomposition plan for generating the required PostgreSQL query:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Identify the Main Tables and Columns Needed**\n- The query requires information from three tables: `object`, `probability`, and `ps1_ztf`.\n- All columns from these tables should be returned for the selected objects.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Define the Selection Criteria**\n\n#### a. **Distance to Nearest PS1 Source**\n- The distance to the nearest PS1 source is given by the column `distpsnr1` in the `ps1_ztf` table.\n- The condition is: `distpsnr1 > 5` (arcsec).\n\n#### b. **Probability Condition (Non-Supernova, Light Curve Classifier)**\n- The `probability` table contains classification probabilities.\n- The classifier must be the light curve classifier: `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`.\n- The probability must be greater than 0.7: `probability > 0.7`.\n- The class must be any class other than supernova. In the context of the ALeRCE schema, supernova classes are: `'SNIa'`, `'SNIbc'`, `'SNII'`, `'SLSN'`.\n- The ranking must be 1: `ranking = 1` (default condition).\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Determine the Required Joins**\n- The three tables are related via the `oid` column.\n- An INNER JOIN should be used between:\n  - `object` and `ps1_ztf` on `oid`\n  - `object` and `probability` on `oid`\n- This ensures only objects present in all three tables and meeting the criteria are selected.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Apply the Filtering Conditions**\n- In the JOINed result, apply the following WHERE conditions:\n  - `ps1_ztf.distpsnr1 > 5`\n  - `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`\n  - `probability.ranking = 1`\n  - `probability.probability > 0.7`\n  - `probability.class_name NOT IN ('SNIa', 'SNIbc', 'SNII', 'SLSN')`\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Select All Columns**\n- Select all columns from `object`, `probability`, and `ps1_ztf`.\n- To avoid ambiguity, use table aliases and select all columns from each table (e.g., `object.*`, `probability.*`, `ps1_ztf.*`).\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Order and Limit the Results**\n- Order the results by the nearest PS1 source distance: `ps1_ztf.distpsnr1` in ascending order.\n- Limit the number of results to 200.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Summary of Steps/Subqueries**\n1. **Subquery/Join Preparation:**\n   - Prepare a JOIN between `object`, `probability`, and `ps1_ztf` on `oid`.\n2. **Apply Filtering:**\n   - In the WHERE clause, apply all the conditions:\n     - `ps1_ztf.distpsnr1 > 5`\n     - `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`\n     - `probability.ranking = 1`\n     - `probability.probability > 0.7`\n     - `probability.class_name NOT IN ('SNIa', 'SNIbc', 'SNII', 'SLSN')`\n3. **Select Columns:**\n   - Select all columns from the three tables.\n4. **Order and Limit:**\n   - Order by `ps1_ztf.distpsnr1` ascending.\n   - Limit to 200 results.\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Additional Considerations**\n- Ensure that the JOINs are INNER JOINs to only include objects present in all three tables.\n- If there are multiple entries per `oid` in `ps1_ztf` (due to multiple `candid` values), consider whether to select only the row with the minimum `distpsnr1` per `oid`. If so, a subquery or window function may be needed to select the closest match per object.\n- If the user wants only the closest PS1 match per object, use a subquery to select, for each `oid`, the row in `ps1_ztf` with the minimum `distpsnr1`.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \n- Join `object`, `probability`, and `ps1_ztf` on `oid`.\n- Filter for `ps1_ztf.distpsnr1 > 5`, `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`, `probability.ranking = 1`, `probability.probability > 0.7`, and `probability.class_name` not in the supernova classes.\n- Select all columns from all three tables.\n- Order by `ps1_ztf.distpsnr1` ascending.\n- Limit to 200 results.\n- Optionally, ensure only the closest PS1 match per object is used if there are multiple matches per `oid`.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Find at most 200 ZTF objects that satisfy the following conditions: have a distance to the nearest PS1 source larger than 5 arcsec, and have a probability larger than 0.7 of being in a class other than supernova in the light curve classifier.

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier' ; this will return the classifications by the light curve classifier\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n# If you need to use 2 tables, try using a INNER JOIN statement, or a sub-query over 'probability' or 'object', if the query requires it.

For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Find at most 500 ZTF objects ordered by their oids that have as a minimum 10 detections in the g band, and have no dubious corrections in that filter.

If not, assume a direct join is possible for this query (or the user expects the join to be possible).\n   - The join sequence will be:\n     - 'magstat.oid' = 'probability.oid'\n     - 'magstat.oid' = 'allwise.oid_catalog' (assuming direct join; if not, a cross-match table would be needed)\n\n5. **Apply the Filtering Conditions:**\n   - In the WHERE clause, apply all the conditions from steps 2 and 3.\n\n6. **Limit the Number of Results:**\n   - The user requests at most 50 objects, so apply a LIMIT 50 clause.\n\n7. **Select All Columns from 'magstat':**\n   - The SELECT statement should include all columns from the 'magstat' table.\n\n8. **Summary of Steps:**\n   - Start from the 'magstat' table.\n   - INNER JOIN with 'probability' on 'oid' with the specified class, classifier, ranking, and probability conditions.\n   - INNER JOIN with 'allwise' on the appropriate key (assume 'oid' = 'oid_catalog' unless a cross-match table is required).\n   - Filter for 'allwise.w1mpro' between 12 and 13.\n   - Select all columns from 'magstat'.\n   - Limit the output to 50 rows.\n\n9. **Check for Ambiguities:**\n   - If the join between 'magstat.oid' and 'allwise.oid_catalog' is not direct, a cross-match table would be required. If so, add a step to join through that table.\n   - If the user expects only unique objects, ensure the query returns unique 'oid' values (e.g., by using DISTINCT if necessary).\n\n10. **Final Output:**\n    - The query will return up to 50 rows, each containing all columns from the 'magstat' table, for ZTF objects that meet the AGN probability and WISE W1 magnitude criteria.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier' ; this will return the classifications by the light curve classifier\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n# If you need to use 2 tables, try using a INNER JOIN statement, or a sub-query over 'probability' or 'object', if the query requires it. It is important to be really careful with the use of sub-queries or JOINs, as they can slow down the query.\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Answer ONLY with the final SQL query, with the following format: \n  ```sql SQL_QUERY_HERE ```\nDON'T include anything else in your answer. If you want to add comments, use the SQL comment format inside the query.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nDecomposition Plan:\n\n1. **Identify the Main Output Table and Columns:**\n   - The user wants all columns from the 'magstat' table for the selected objects.\n   - The final SELECT statement should retrieve all columns from 'magstat'.\n\n2. **Determine the Filtering Criteria:**\n   - Objects must have a probability > 0.6 of being classified as 'AGN' by the light curve classifier.\n   - The probability table must be filtered for:\n     - class_name = 'AGN'\n     - classifier_name = 'lc_classifier' (default condition)\n     - ranking = 1 (default condition)\n     - probability > 0.6\n   - Objects must have a WISE W1 magnitude (w1mpro) between 12 and 13 in the 'allwise' table.\n\n3. **Establish Table Relationships and Joins:**\n   - The 'probability' table contains the ZTF object identifier (oid).\n   - The 'magstat' table also uses oid as the object identifier.\n   - The 'allwise' table uses oid_catalog as its identifier, which is not directly the ZTF oid.\n   - To relate ZTF oids to WISE sources, a cross-match table (not described in the schema above) is typically required. However, since only the provided tables are to be used, assume that the necessary join between ZTF oid and WISE oid_catalog is available or that the oid in 'magstat' and 'probability' can be joined to 'allwise' (if not, this step would need to be clarified or a join via a cross-match table would be required).\n\n4. **Construct the Filtering Subquery for Probability:**\n   - Create a subquery or CTE that selects oids from 'probability' where:\n     - class_name = 'AGN'\n     - classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'\n     - ranking = 1\n     - probability > 0.6\n\n5. **Filter WISE Sources by W1 Magnitude:**\n   - Select sources from 'allwise' where:\n     - w1mpro >= 12 AND w1mpro <= 13\n\n6. **Combine the Filters:**\n   - Join the filtered oids from the probability subquery with the filtered sources from 'allwise' on the appropriate identifier (if a cross-match table is available, use it; otherwise, join directly if possible).\n   - Join the resulting set with 'magstat' on oid to retrieve all columns from 'magstat' for the matching objects.\n\n7. **Limit the Number of Results:**\n   - Apply a LIMIT 50 clause to return at most 50 objects.\n\n8. **Summary of Steps:**\n   - a. Filter 'probability' for AGN, lc_classifier, ranking=1, probability>0.6.\n   - b. Filter 'allwise' for w1mpro between 12 and 13.\n   - c. Join the filtered results on the appropriate object identifier.\n   - d. Join with 'magstat' to get all columns for the selected objects.\n   - e. Limit the output to 50 rows.\n\n9. **Assumptions and Notes:**\n   - If a cross-match table is required to relate ZTF oids to WISE oid_catalog, include it in the join.\n   - If not, and if the oid in 'magstat' and 'probability' can be directly joined to 'allwise', proceed accordingly.\n   - If the user expects only unique objects, ensure the query does not return duplicate rows for the same object.\n\nThis step-by-step plan ensures all user requirements and database constraints are addressed for optimal and accurate query generation.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Find at most 50 ZTF objects that satisfy the following conditions: have a probability larger than 0.6 of being an AGN in the light curve classifier, and a WISE W1 magnitude between 12 and 13.

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier' ; this will return the classifications by the light curve classifier\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n# If you need to use 2 tables, try using a INNER JOIN statement, or a sub-query over 'probability' or 'object', if the query requires it. It is important to be really careful with the use of sub-queries or JOINs, as they can slow down the query.\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Answer ONLY with the final SQL query, with the following format: \n  ```sql SQL_QUERY_HERE ```\nDON'T include anything else in your answer. If you want to add comments, use the SQL comment format inside the query.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\n**Decomposition Plan for the User Request:**\n\n1. **Identify the Main Selection Table and Filtering Conditions:**\n   - The main selection is on ZTF objects (from the `object` table) that have a high probability (>0.9) of being classified as 'asteroid' by the stamp classifier, specifically version 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'.\n   - The relevant classification information is in the `probability` table.\n   - The required conditions for the `probability` table are:\n     - `class_name = 'asteroid'`\n     - `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`\n     - `classifier_version = 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'`\n     - `probability > 0.9`\n   - Limit the results to at most 30 objects.\n\n2. **Determine the Required Output Columns:**\n   - ZTF object identifier: `object.oid`\n   - Candidate identifier: `detection.candid`\n   - Distance from nearest Solar System object: `ss_ztf.ssdistnr`\n   - MPC archive magnitude: `ss_ztf.ssmagnr`\n   - Name of nearest Solar System object: `ss_ztf.ssnamenr`\n   - Filter identifier: `detection.fid`\n   - FWHM from SExtractor: (This is not present in the provided schema; check if it is available in any table or if it needs to be omitted or replaced.)\n   - Number of PS1 calibrators used: (This is also not present in the provided schema; check if it is available in any table or if it needs to be omitted or replaced.)\n   - Exposure time: (This is not present in the provided schema; check if it is available in any table or if it needs to be omitted or replaced.)\n\n3. **Establish Table Relationships and Joins:**\n   - Start from the `probability` table (filtered as above).\n   - Join to the `object` table using `probability.oid = object.oid`.\n   - Join to the `ss_ztf` table using `object.oid = ss_ztf.oid` to get Solar System object information.\n   - Join to the `detection` table using `object.oid = detection.oid` to get candidate and filter information.\n   - If FWHM, number of PS1 calibrators, or exposure time are present in another table, join to that table as well. If not, these columns cannot be included.\n\n4. **Apply the Result Limitation:**\n   - Limit the total number of returned rows to 30.\n\n5. **Select the Required Columns:**\n   - In the SELECT clause, include:\n     - `object.oid` (ZTF object identifier)\n     - `detection.candid` (candidate identifier)\n     - `ss_ztf.ssdistnr` (distance to nearest Solar System object)\n     - `ss_ztf.ssmagnr` (MPC archive magnitude)\n     - `ss_ztf.ssnamenr` (name of nearest Solar System object)\n     - `detection.fid` (filter identifier)\n     - FWHM from SExtractor (if available)\n     - Number of PS1 calibrators used (if available)\n     - Exposure time (if available)\n\n6. **Handle Potential Duplicates:**\n   - If multiple detections per object exist, decide whether to return all or just the first/most recent detection per object. If not specified, return all matching detections up to the limit.\n\n7. **Order the Results (Optional):**\n   - If a specific ordering is desired (e.g., by probability descending, or by most recent detection), specify the ordering. Otherwise, default ordering is acceptable.\n\n8. **Final Review:**\n   - Ensure all required columns are present and all joins are correct.\n   - If any requested columns are not available in the schema, document their absence and proceed without them.\n\n**Summary of Steps:**\n- Filter `probability` for 'asteroid', 'stamp_classifier', version 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4', and probability > 0.9.\n- Join to `object` for object information.\n- Join to `ss_ztf` for Solar System object details.\n- Join to `detection` for candidate and filter information.\n- Attempt to include FWHM, number of PS1 calibrators, and exposure time if available in the schema.\n- Select the specified columns.\n- Limit results to 30.\n- Handle duplicates and ordering as appropriate.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Find at most 30 ZTF objects that have a probability larger than 0.9 of being an asteroid in the stamp classifier version 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'.

If these are not available, they cannot be included unless they are in a different table not listed.\n\n2. **Set Filtering Conditions:**\n   - In the `probability` table:\n     - `class_name = 'asteroid'`\n     - `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`\n     - `classifier_version = 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'`\n     - `probability > 0.9`\n   - No explicit ranking condition is needed since the user did not specify it, and the default for `stamp_classifier` is not required unless specified.\n   - Limit the results to at most 30 objects.\n\n3. **Determine Required Output Columns:**\n   - ZTF object identifier: `object.oid`\n   - Candidate identifier: `detection.candid`\n   - Distance from nearest Solar System object: `ss_ztf.ssdistnr`\n   - MPC archive magnitude: `ss_ztf.ssmagnr`\n   - Name of nearest Solar System object: `ss_ztf.ssnamenr`\n   - Filter identifier: `detection.fid`\n   - FWHM from SExtractor: (Not available in schema; cannot be included)\n   - Number of PS1 calibrators used: (Not available in schema; cannot be included)\n   - Exposure time: (Not available in schema; cannot be included)\n\n4. **Establish Table Relationships and Joins:**\n   - Join `probability` to `object` using `oid`.\n   - Join `object` to `ss_ztf` using `oid`.\n   - Join `object` to `detection` using `oid`.\n   - If there are multiple detections per object, decide whether to select a specific detection (e.g., the first or last) or return all detections. If not specified, return all detections for each object.\n\n5. **Assemble the Query Structure:**\n   - Start from the `probability` table, applying the specified filters.\n   - Join to the `object` table to get the object identifier.\n   - Join to the `ss_ztf` table to get Solar System object information.\n   - Join to the `detection` table to get candidate-specific information.\n   - Select the required columns.\n   - Limit the output to 30 rows.\n\n6. **Order and Limit Results:**\n   - Apply a `LIMIT 30` clause to restrict the number of results to at most 30 objects.\n   - If the user wants the highest probabilities, order by `probability.probability DESC`. Otherwise, no specific order is required.\n\n7. **Document Limitations:**\n   - Note that \"FWHM from SExtractor\", \"number of PS1 calibrators used\", and \"exposure time\" are not available in the provided schema and cannot be included in the output.\n\n**Summary of Steps:**\n- Filter the `probability` table for objects classified as 'asteroid' by the 'stamp_classifier' version 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4' with probability > 0.9.\n- Join with the `object` table to get the object identifier.\n- Join with the `ss_ztf` table to get Solar System object distance, magnitude, and name.\n- Join with the `detection` table to get candidate identifier and filter identifier.\n- Select the required columns.\n- Limit the results to 30.\n- Exclude unavailable columns from the output.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

If these are present in another table or as columns in `detection` or another table, they should be included; otherwise, note their absence.\n   - The MPC archive magnitude is assumed to be `ssmagnr` from `ss_ztf`.\n\n2. **Set Filtering Conditions:**\n   - Only include objects classified as 'asteroid' by the stamp classifier.\n   - Use only the classifier version 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'.\n   - Only include rows where the probability is greater than 0.9.\n   - Only include the most likely class per object (`probability.ranking = 1`).\n   - Limit the result to at most 30 objects.\n\n3. **Determine Required Joins:**\n   - Join `probability` to `object` using `oid` to get the object identifier.\n   - Join `ss_ztf` to `object` using `oid` to get Solar System object information.\n   - Join `detection` to `object` using `oid` to get candidate and filter information.\n   - If FWHM, number of PS1 calibrators, and exposure time are in another table, join that table as well.\n\n4. **Select Required Columns:**\n   - ZTF object identifier: `object.oid`\n   - Candidate identifier: `detection.candid`\n   - Distance from nearest Solar System object: `ss_ztf.ssdistnr`\n   - MPC archive magnitude: `ss_ztf.ssmagnr`\n   - Name of nearest Solar System object: `ss_ztf.ssnamenr`\n   - Filter identifier: `detection.fid`\n   - FWHM from SExtractor: (if available, specify the table and column)\n   - Number of PS1 calibrators used: (if available, specify the table and column)\n   - Exposure time: (if available, specify the table and column)\n\n5. **Apply Result Limiting and Output Formatting:**\n   - Limit the output to 30 rows.\n   - Ensure all required columns are included in the output.\n\n6. **Handle Missing Columns:**\n   - If FWHM from SExtractor, number of PS1 calibrators, and exposure time are not present in the schema, note that these columns cannot be included unless additional table information is provided.\n\n7. **Order of Operations:**\n   - Filter the `probability` table for the required class, classifier, version, probability, and ranking.\n   - Join with `object` to get the object identifier.\n   - Join with `ss_ztf` to get Solar System object information.\n   - Join with `detection` to get candidate and filter information.\n   - Select the required columns.\n   - Limit the result to 30 rows.\n\n**Summary of Steps:**\n1. Filter `probability` for class_name = 'asteroid', classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier', classifier_version = 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4', probability > 0.9, and ranking = 1.\n2. Join with `object` on `oid`.\n3. Join with `ss_ztf` on `oid` to get Solar System object details.\n4. Join with `detection` on `oid` to get candidate and filter information.\n5. (If available) Join with the table(s) containing FWHM from SExtractor, number of PS1 calibrators, and exposure time.\n6. Select the columns: `object.oid`, `detection.candid`, `ss_ztf.ssdistnr`, `ss_ztf.ssmagnr`, `ss_ztf.ssnamenr`, `detection.fid`, (plus FWHM, PS1 calibrators, exposure time if available).\n7. Limit the output to 30 rows.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Find at most 30 ZTF objects that have a probability larger than 0.9 of being an asteroid in the stamp classifier version 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'.

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier' ; this will return the classifications by the light curve classifier\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n# If you need to use 2 tables, try using a INNER JOIN statement, or a sub-query over 'probability' or 'object', if the query requires it. It is important to be really careful with the use of sub-queries or JOINs, as they can slow down the query.\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Answer ONLY with the final SQL query, with the following format: \n  ```sql SQL_QUERY_HERE ```\nDON'T include anything else in your answer. If you want to add comments, use the SQL comment format inside the query.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\n**Decomposition Plan for the User Request:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**\n   - The main object identifier is in the `object` table (`oid`).\n   - The candidate identifier is in the `detection` table (`candid`).\n   - The probability and classification information is in the `probability` table (`probability`).\n   - Information about the nearest Solar System object is in the `ss_ztf` table (`ssdistnr`, `ssmagnr`, `ssnamenr`).\n   - The filter identifier is in the `detection` table (`fid`).\n   - The FWHM from SExtractor, number of PS1 calibrators used, and exposure time are not present in the provided schema. If these are in another table or as custom columns, you would need to specify the table and column names. For now, assume they are in the `detection` table as `fwhmsex`, `ncalib`, and `exptime` respectively (if not, this step will need adjustment).\n\n2. **Set Filtering Conditions on the Probability Table:**\n   - Only select rows where:\n     - `probability.class_name = 'asteroid'`\n     - `probability.classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`\n     - `probability.classifier_version = 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'`\n     - `probability.probability > 0.9`\n   - No need to filter on `ranking` since the user did not specify it and the default is not to filter for stamp_classifier.\n\n3. **Join Tables to Gather All Required Information:**\n   - Join `probability` to `object` on `oid` to get the ZTF object identifier.\n   - Join `probability` to `ss_ztf` on `oid` to get Solar System object information (`ssdistnr`, `ssmagnr`, `ssnamenr`).\n   - Join `probability` to `detection` on `oid` to get candidate information (`candid`, `fid`, and assumed `fwhmsex`, `ncalib`, `exptime`).\n\n4. **Select the Required Columns:**\n   - ZTF object identifier: `object.oid`\n   - Candidate identifier: `detection.candid`\n   - Distance from nearest Solar System object: `ss_ztf.ssdistnr`\n   - MPC archive magnitude: `ss_ztf.ssmagnr`\n   - Name of Solar System object: `ss_ztf.ssnamenr`\n   - Filter identifier: `detection.fid`\n   - FWHM from SExtractor: `detection.fwhmsex` (assumed)\n   - Number of PS1 calibrators used: `detection.ncalib` (assumed)\n   - Exposure time: `detection.exptime` (assumed)\n\n5. **Limit the Number of Results:**\n   - Restrict the output to at most 30 rows.\n\n6. **Handle Potential Duplicates:**\n   - If multiple candidates exist for the same object, decide whether to return all or only the latest/first candidate per object. The user did not specify, so return all matching candidates up to the limit.\n\n7. **Order the Results (Optional):**\n   - The user did not specify an order, so no explicit ordering is required unless you want to prioritize by probability or recency.\n\n8. **Summary of Steps:**\n   - Filter the `probability` table for objects classified as 'asteroid' by the specified classifier and version, with probability > 0.9.\n   - Join with `object` to get the ZTF identifier.\n   - Join with `ss_ztf` to get Solar System object information.\n   - Join with `detection` to get candidate and assumed additional columns.\n   - Select the specified columns.\n   - Limit the result to 30 rows.\n\n**Note:** If the columns for FWHM from SExtractor, number of PS1 calibrators, and exposure time are not in the `detection` table, you will need to identify the correct table and column names for these fields and adjust the join and select steps accordingly.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Find at most 30 ZTF objects that have a probability larger than 0.9 of being an asteroid in the stamp classifier version 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'.

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier'\n### IF THE 'feature' TABLE is used with 2 or more features, you need to take the following steps, because it is a transposed table (each feature is in a different row).\nI. Create a sub-query using the 'probability' TABLE filtering the desired objects.\nII. For each feature, you have to make a sub-query retrieving the specific feature adding the condition of its value, taking only the oids in the 'probability' sub-query with an INNER JOIN inside each 'feature' sub-query to retrieve only the features associated with the desired spatial objects.\nIII. Make an UNION between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nIV. Make an INTERSECT between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nV. Filter the 'UNION' query from step III selecting only the 'oids' that are in the 'INTERSECT' query from step IV\nVI. Add the remaining conditions to the final result of step V, using the 'probability' sub-query from step I.\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nTo generate a PostgreSQL query that retrieves at most 10 ZTF objects meeting the specified conditions and returns the requested columns, follow this detailed decomposition plan:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**\n- **object**: Contains ZTF object statistics, including:\n  - `oid` (ZTF identifier)\n  - `ndet` (number of detections)\n  - `firstmjd` (first detection date)\n  - `lastmjd` (last detection date)\n- **probability**: Contains classification probabilities, including:\n  - `oid` (ZTF identifier)\n  - `class_name` (should be 'asteroid')\n  - `classifier_name` (should be 'stamp_classifier')\n  - `classifier_version` (should be 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4')\n  - `probability` (probability value)\n- **ss_ztf**: Contains Solar System object cross-match info, including:\n  - `oid` (ZTF identifier)\n  - `candid` (candidate identifier)\n  - `ssdistnr` (distance to nearest Solar System object, in arcsec)\n  - `ssnamenr` (MPC name)\n- **detection**: Contains detection events, including:\n  - `candid` (candidate identifier)\n  - `oid` (ZTF identifier)\n  - `mjd` (detection date)\n  - `fid` (filter identifier)\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Define Filtering Conditions**\n- **object.ndet > 500**: Only objects with more than 500 detections.\n- **probability.class_name = 'asteroid'**\n- **probability.classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'**\n- **probability.classifier_version = 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'**\n- **probability.probability > 0.5**\n- **ss_ztf.ssdistnr < 2**: Distance to nearest Solar System object below 2 arcsec.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Determine Required Columns for Output**\n- ZTF identifier: `object.oid`\n- Number of detections: `object.ndet`\n- First detection date: `object.firstmjd`\n- Last detection date: `object.lastmjd`\n- Probability: `probability.probability`\n- Candidate identifier: `ss_ztf.candid`\n- Distance between ZTF object and MPC object: `ss_ztf.ssdistnr`\n- MPC name: `ss_ztf.ssnamenr`\n- Detection date: `detection.mjd`\n- Filter identifier: `detection.fid`\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Plan Table Joins and Subqueries**\n- **Join `object` and `probability`** on `oid` to filter objects by detection count and probability conditions.\n- **Join `ss_ztf`** on `oid` to filter by Solar System object distance and retrieve candidate/MPC info.\n- **Join `detection`** on `oid` and `candid` to get detection date and filter identifier for the specific candidate.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Detailed Step-by-Step Decomposition**\n\n#### **Step 1: Filter Objects by Detection Count**\n- Select from `object` where `ndet > 500`.\n\n#### **Step 2: Filter Probabilities**\n- Select from `probability` where:\n  - `class_name = 'asteroid'`\n  - `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`\n  - `classifier_version = 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'`\n  - `probability > 0.5`\n\n#### **Step 3: Join Filtered Objects and Probabilities**\n- INNER JOIN the filtered `object` and `probability` tables on `oid` to get objects that satisfy both detection and probability conditions.\n\n#### **Step 4: Filter and Join Solar System Cross-Match**\n- INNER JOIN the result with `ss_ztf` on `oid` where `ssdistnr < 2` to get only objects close to a known Solar System object.\n\n#### **Step 5: Join Detection Table for Candidate Details**\n- INNER JOIN the result with `detection` on both `oid` and `candid` to get the detection date (`mjd`) and filter identifier (`fid`) for the specific candidate.\n\n#### **Step 6: Select Required Columns**\n- From the joined tables, select:\n  - `object.oid`\n  - `object.ndet`\n  - `object.firstmjd`\n  - `object.lastmjd`\n  - `probability.probability`\n  - `ss_ztf.candid`\n  - `ss_ztf.ssdistnr`\n  - `ss_ztf.ssnamenr`\n  - `detection.mjd`\n  - `detection.fid`\n\n#### **Step 7: Order and Limit Results**\n- Order the results by `object.firstmjd` (first detection date).\n- Limit the output to at most 10 rows.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Summary of Query Structure**\n- The query will use multiple INNER JOINs between `object`, `probability`, `ss_ztf`, and `detection`.\n- Filtering will be applied at each join step to ensure only objects meeting all criteria are included.\n- The final SELECT will include all requested columns.\n- The result will be ordered by the first detection date and limited to 10 entries.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Additional Considerations**\n- Ensure that the join between `detection` and `ss_ztf` uses both `oid` and `candid` to get the correct detection event for the candidate.\n- If there are multiple detections per candidate, ensure only the relevant detection is selected (since `candid` is unique in `detection`, this should be straightforward).\n- All column and table names must match exactly as in the schema.\n\n---\n\n**This step-by-step plan ensures that the resulting SQL query will be accurate, efficient, and will return the exact information requested by the user.**\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Find at most 10 ZTF objects that satisfy the following conditions: have more than 500 detections, a probability larger than 0.5 of being an asteroid in the stamp classifier version 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4', and a distance from the nearest Solar System object below 2 arcsec.

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier'\n### IF THE 'feature' TABLE is used with 2 or more features, you need to take the following steps, because it is a transposed table (each feature is in a different row).\nI. Create a sub-query using the 'probability' TABLE filtering the desired objects.\nII. For each feature, you have to make a sub-query retrieving the specific feature adding the condition of its value, taking only the oids in the 'probability' sub-query with an INNER JOIN inside each 'feature' sub-query to retrieve only the features associated with the desired spatial objects.\nIII. Make an UNION between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nIV. Make an INTERSECT between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nV. Filter the 'UNION' query from step III selecting only the 'oids' that are in the 'INTERSECT' query from step IV\nVI. Add the remaining conditions to the final result of step V, using the 'probability' sub-query from step I.\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nTo generate a PostgreSQL query that retrieves at most 10 ZTF objects meeting the specified conditions and returns the requested columns, follow this detailed decomposition plan:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**\n- **object**: Contains ZTF object statistics, including:\n  - `oid` (ZTF identifier)\n  - `ndet` (number of detections)\n  - `firstmjd` (first detection date)\n  - `lastmjd` (last detection date)\n- **probability**: Contains classification probabilities, including:\n  - `oid` (ZTF identifier)\n  - `class_name` (should be 'asteroid')\n  - `classifier_name` (should be 'stamp_classifier')\n  - `classifier_version` (should be 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4')\n  - `probability` (probability value)\n- **ss_ztf**: Contains Solar System object cross-match info, including:\n  - `oid` (ZTF identifier)\n  - `candid` (candidate identifier)\n  - `ssdistnr` (distance to nearest Solar System object, in arcsec)\n  - `ssnamenr` (MPC name)\n- **detection**: Contains detection events, including:\n  - `candid` (candidate identifier)\n  - `oid` (ZTF identifier)\n  - `mjd` (detection date)\n  - `fid` (filter identifier)\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Define Filtering Conditions**\n- **object.ndet > 500**: Only objects with more than 500 detections.\n- **probability.class_name = 'asteroid'**\n- **probability.classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'**\n- **probability.classifier_version = 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'**\n- **probability.probability > 0.5**\n- **ss_ztf.ssdistnr < 2**: Distance to nearest Solar System object below 2 arcsec.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Determine Required Columns for Output**\n- ZTF identifier: `object.oid`\n- Number of detections: `object.ndet`\n- First detection date: `object.firstmjd`\n- Last detection date: `object.lastmjd`\n- Probability: `probability.probability`\n- Candidate identifier: `ss_ztf.candid`\n- Distance between ZTF object and MPC object: `ss_ztf.ssdistnr`\n- MPC name: `ss_ztf.ssnamenr`\n- Detection date: `detection.mjd`\n- Filter identifier: `detection.fid`\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Plan Table Joins and Subqueries**\n- **Join `object` and `probability`** on `oid` to filter objects by detection count and probability conditions.\n- **Join `ss_ztf`** on `oid` to get Solar System object cross-match info.\n- **Join `detection`** on both `oid` and `candid` to get detection date and filter identifier for the specific candidate associated with the Solar System cross-match.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Apply Filtering and Ordering**\n- Apply all filtering conditions in the `WHERE` clause.\n- Order the results by `object.firstmjd` (first detection date).\n- Limit the results to at most 10 objects.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Detailed Step-by-Step Decomposition**\n1. **Subquery 1: Filter objects with more than 500 detections**\n   - Select from `object` where `ndet > 500`.\n\n2. **Subquery 2: Filter probability for 'asteroid' in 'stamp_classifier' version 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4' with probability > 0.5**\n   - Select from `probability` where:\n     - `class_name = 'asteroid'`\n     - `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`\n     - `classifier_version = 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'`\n     - `probability > 0.5`\n\n3. **Join Subquery 1 and Subquery 2 on `oid`**\n   - This gives objects with sufficient detections and high asteroid probability.\n\n4. **Join with `ss_ztf` on `oid`**\n   - Filter where `ssdistnr < 2`.\n\n5. **Join with `detection` on both `oid` and `candid`**\n   - This ensures the detection corresponds to the candidate associated with the Solar System cross-match.\n\n6. **Select the required columns from the joined tables**\n   - `object.oid`, `object.ndet`, `object.firstmjd`, `object.lastmjd`, `probability.probability`, `ss_ztf.candid`, `ss_ztf.ssdistnr`, `ss_ztf.ssnamenr`, `detection.mjd`, `detection.fid`\n\n7. **Order by `object.firstmjd` (first detection date)**\n   - Ensures results are sorted as requested.\n\n8. **Limit the results to 10**\n   - Use a limit to return at most 10 objects.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Summary of Query Structure**\n- The main query will be a multi-table join between `object`, `probability`, `ss_ztf`, and `detection`.\n- All filtering conditions are applied in the `WHERE` clause.\n- The join between `detection` and `ss_ztf` must be on both `oid` and `candid` to ensure the correct detection is selected.\n- The final result is ordered and limited as specified.\n\n---\n\nThis step-by-step plan ensures all user requirements are met, using optimal joins and filters, and returns the precise columns requested.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Find at most 10 ZTF objects that satisfy the following conditions: have more than 500 detections, a probability larger than 0.5 of being an asteroid in the stamp classifier version 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4', and a distance from the nearest Solar System object below 2 arcsec.

This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n# If you need to use 2 tables, try using a INNER JOIN statement, or a sub-query over 'probability' or 'object', if the query requires it.

If you want to add comments, use the SQL comment format inside the query.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nDecomposition Plan:\n\n1. **Identify the ZTF Object in the 'object' Table**\n   - Locate the row in the 'object' table where the 'oid' column matches 'ZTF19aascdol'.\n   - Retrieve the mean right ascension ('meanra') and mean declination ('meandec') for this object, as these will be used for spatial cross-matching.\n\n2. **Cross-match with ALLWISE Catalog Using Spatial Proximity**\n   - Use the coordinates ('meanra', 'meandec') from the 'object' table to find matching sources in the 'allwise' table.\n   - Perform a spatial join using a Q3C function (such as q3c_join or q3c_radial_query) to identify ALLWISE sources within a reasonable angular distance of the ZTF object. The specific radius is not specified by the user, so use a typical cross-match radius (e.g., 3 arcseconds or 0.000833 degrees) unless otherwise specified.\n   - For each match, calculate the angular distance between the ZTF object and the ALLWISE source using the q3c_dist function, with the ZTF object's 'meanra'/'meandec' and the ALLWISE source's 'ra'/'dec'.\n\n3. **Select Required Columns for Output**\n   - From the 'object' table: select the ZTF object identifier ('oid').\n   - From the 'allwise' table: select the ALLWISE catalog identifier ('oid_catalog'), and the WISE magnitudes in filters W1 to W4 ('w1mpro', 'w2mpro', 'w3mpro', 'w4mpro').\n   - Include the calculated distance between the ZTF and ALLWISE positions as an additional column in the output.\n\n4. **Assemble the Final Output**\n   - For each ALLWISE match found, return a row containing:\n     - The ZTF object identifier ('oid')\n     - The ALLWISE catalog identifier ('oid_catalog')\n     - The distance between the ZTF and ALLWISE positions (in degrees)\n     - The WISE W1 to W4 magnitudes ('w1mpro', 'w2mpro', 'w3mpro', 'w4mpro')\n\n5. **(Optional) Order or Filter Results**\n   - If multiple ALLWISE matches are found, order the results by distance (ascending) to show the closest match first.\n   - If only the closest match is desired, limit the output to the nearest ALLWISE source.\n\n6. **Summary of Tables and Columns Used**\n   - 'object': 'oid', 'meanra', 'meandec'\n   - 'allwise': 'oid_catalog', 'ra', 'dec', 'w1mpro', 'w2mpro', 'w3mpro', 'w4mpro'\n   - Q3C functions: q3c_dist (for distance calculation), q3c_join or q3c_radial_query (for spatial matching)\n\n7. **No Additional Filters or Joins Needed**\n   - Since the user request is specific to a single ZTF object and its ALLWISE matches, no additional filters or joins are required beyond the spatial cross-match.\n\nThis plan ensures that the query will return, for the specified ZTF object, all relevant ALLWISE matches with their identifiers, the distance between the counterparts, and the requested WISE magnitudes.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier' ; this will return the classifications by the light curve classifier\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n# If you need to use 2 tables, try using a INNER JOIN statement, or a sub-query over 'probability' or 'object', if the query requires it. It is important to be really careful with the use of sub-queries or JOINs, as they can slow down the query.\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Answer ONLY with the final SQL query, with the following format: \n  ```sql SQL_QUERY_HERE ```\nDON'T include anything else in your answer. If you want to add comments, use the SQL comment format inside the query.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\n**Decomposition Plan for the User Request:**\n\n1. **Define the Solar System Objects of Interest**\n   - Identify the two Solar System object identifiers: '2003FP134' and '2009UK56'.\n   - These correspond to the 'ssnamenr' column in the 'ss_ztf' table.\n\n2. **Retrieve Positions of the Solar System Objects**\n   - For each of the two identifiers, obtain their celestial coordinates (RA, Dec).\n   - Since the ALeRCE schema does not provide a direct table for Solar System object coordinates, assume that the user will provide these coordinates, or that they are available from an external source.\n   - If not, the query should be structured to accept these as input parameters (e.g., via a WITH clause defining a temporary 'catalog' table with columns: source_id, ra, dec).\n\n3. **Identify ZTF Objects Near the Solar System Objects**\n   - For each Solar System object (with its RA, Dec), find all ZTF objects (from the 'detection' table) whose (ra, dec) coordinates are within 2 arcseconds (2/3600 degrees) of the Solar System object's position.\n   - Use the Q3C function q3c_radial_query for efficient spatial matching.\n   - This step may require a cross join between the temporary 'catalog' table (with the Solar System objects and their coordinates) and the 'detection' table, applying the q3c_radial_query condition.\n\n4. **Retrieve Associated ZTF Object Identifiers**\n   - For each detection found in the previous step, extract the 'oid' (object identifier) from the 'detection' table.\n   - This will be used to join with the 'ss_ztf' table.\n\n5. **Join with the 'ss_ztf' Table**\n   - For each 'oid' identified, retrieve all rows from the 'ss_ztf' table where 'oid' matches.\n   - Filter the 'ss_ztf' rows to only those where 'ssnamenr' is either '2003FP134' or '2009UK56'.\n\n6. **Join with the 'detection' Table**\n   - For each matching 'oid', join with the 'detection' table to retrieve all detections for these objects.\n   - Select the required columns from the 'detection' table: \n     - detection date ('mjd')\n     - filter identifier ('fid')\n     - isdiffpos flag ('isdiffpos')\n     - RA ('ra')\n     - Dec ('dec')\n     - difference magnitude ('magpsf')\n     - difference magnitude uncertainty ('sigmapsf')\n\n7. **Select Required Columns**\n   - From the 'ss_ztf' table: select all columns.\n   - From the 'detection' table: select the specified columns above.\n\n8. **Sort the Results**\n   - Sort the final results by 'ssnamenr' (MPC name) and detection date ('mjd') in ascending order.\n\n9. **Output**\n   - The final output should be a table with all columns from 'ss_ztf' and the specified columns from 'detection', for all detections of ZTF objects within 2 arcseconds of either '2003FP134' or '2009UK56', sorted as specified.\n\n**Summary of Steps:**\n1. Define a temporary table (WITH clause) for the Solar System objects and their coordinates.\n2. Use q3c_radial_query to find all detections within 2 arcseconds of these coordinates.\n3. Extract the 'oid' for these detections.\n4. Join with 'ss_ztf' to get all rows for these oids, filtering for the two Solar System object names.\n5. Join with 'detection' to get all detections for these oids.\n6. Select all columns from 'ss_ztf' and the specified columns from 'detection'.\n7. Sort by 'ssnamenr' and 'mjd'.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n- The coordinates (RA, Dec) for '2003FP134' and '2009UK56' are available or provided.\n- The user wants all detections for all ZTF objects within 2 arcseconds of either Solar System object, not just the closest match.\n- The output includes all columns from 'ss_ztf' and the specified subset from 'detection'.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''For Solar System identifiers '2003FP134' and '2009UK56', get all detections for all ZTF objects that lie within 2 arcsec from any of them.

If you want to add comments, use the SQL comment format inside the query.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nDecomposition Plan:\n\n1. **Define the Solar System Objects of Interest**\n   - Identify the two Solar System object identifiers: '2003FP134' and '2009UK56'.\n   - These correspond to the 'ssnamenr' column in the 'ss_ztf' table.\n\n2. **Retrieve All ZTF Objects Associated with These Solar System Objects**\n   - Query the 'ss_ztf' table to select all rows where 'ssnamenr' is either '2003FP134' or '2009UK56'.\n   - For each matching row, extract the associated ZTF object identifier ('oid'), as well as the Solar System object\u2019s coordinates if available (however, the 'ss_ztf' table does not store coordinates; you will need to obtain the coordinates for these Solar System objects from an external source or define them in the query).\n\n3. **Define the Coordinates for the Solar System Objects**\n   - Since the coordinates for '2003FP134' and '2009UK56' are not present in the database, you must define them within the query using a WITH clause (as a temporary table named, for example, 'catalog'), specifying their RA and Dec values (these must be provided or looked up externally).\n\n4. **Identify All ZTF Objects Within 2 Arcseconds of Either Solar System Object**\n   - Use the Q3C extension\u2019s spatial matching functions to find all ZTF objects (from the 'detection' table) whose coordinates (ra, dec) are within 2 arcseconds (which is 2/3600 degrees) of the coordinates of either '2003FP134' or '2009UK56'.\n   - This requires a cross-match between the 'detection' table and the temporary 'catalog' table containing the Solar System object coordinates, using q3c_join or q3c_radial_query.\n\n5. **Retrieve All Detections for the Matched ZTF Objects**\n   - For each detection in the 'detection' table that matches the spatial criteria, retrieve the following columns:\n     - 'mjd' (detection date)\n     - 'fid' (filter identifier)\n     - 'isdiffpos' (isdiffpos flag)\n     - 'ra' and 'dec' (coordinates)\n     - 'magpsf' (difference magnitude)\n     - 'sigmapsf' (uncertainty of difference magnitude)\n\n6. **Combine Detection Information with Solar System Object Information**\n   - For each detection that matches the spatial criteria, join with the 'ss_ztf' table on 'oid' to retrieve all columns from 'ss_ztf' for the corresponding ZTF object.\n   - This ensures that for each detection, you have both the detection details and the associated Solar System object information.\n\n7. **Select and Return the Required Columns**\n   - In the final result set, include:\n     - All columns from the 'ss_ztf' table (for the matched ZTF object and Solar System object)\n     - The detection date ('mjd'), filter identifier ('fid'), isdiffpos flag ('isdiffpos'), RA ('ra'), Dec ('dec'), difference magnitude ('magpsf'), and its uncertainty ('sigmapsf') from the 'detection' table.\n\n8. **Sort the Results**\n   - Sort the final output first by the Solar System object name ('ssnamenr', which is the MPC name), and then by detection date ('mjd') in ascending order.\n\n9. **Summary of Steps**\n   - a. Define a temporary table with the Solar System object names and their coordinates.\n   - b. Use a spatial join (Q3C) to find all detections within 2 arcseconds of these coordinates.\n   - c. Join the matching detections with the 'ss_ztf' table to get all Solar System object information.\n   - d. Select the required columns.\n   - e. Sort the results by Solar System object name and detection date.\n\n**Note:** You must provide the RA and Dec for '2003FP134' and '2009UK56' in the query for the spatial match to work. If not available, the query cannot be constructed.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier' ; this will return the classifications by the light curve classifier\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n# If you need to use 2 tables, try using a INNER JOIN statement, or a sub-query over 'probability' or 'object', if the query requires it. It is important to be really careful with the use of sub-queries or JOINs, as they can slow down the query.\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Answer ONLY with the final SQL query, with the following format: \n  ```sql SQL_QUERY_HERE ```\nDON'T include anything else in your answer. If you want to add comments, use the SQL comment format inside the query.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nDecomposition Plan:\n\n1. **Define the Solar System Objects of Interest**\n   - Identify the two Solar System object identifiers: '2003FP134' and '2009UK56'.\n   - These correspond to the 'ssnamenr' column in the 'ss_ztf' table.\n\n2. **Retrieve Positions of the Solar System Objects**\n   - For each of the two identifiers, obtain their right ascension (ra) and declination (dec) coordinates.\n   - These coordinates are not directly available in the 'ss_ztf' table, so you need to define them explicitly (e.g., using a WITH clause and VALUES) if you have their positions, or assume they are provided.\n\n3. **Create a Temporary Catalog Table**\n   - Use a WITH clause to define a temporary table (e.g., 'catalog') containing the source_id (MPC name), ra, and dec for '2003FP134' and '2009UK56'.\n   - This table will be used for spatial cross-matching.\n\n4. **Identify ZTF Objects Near the Solar System Objects**\n   - Use the Q3C extension's q3c_join or q3c_radial_query function to find all ZTF objects (from the 'ss_ztf' table) whose positions (ra, dec) are within 2 arcseconds (2/3600 degrees) of any of the positions in the 'catalog' table.\n   - This requires joining the 'ss_ztf' table with the 'catalog' table using the Q3C spatial function.\n\n5. **Retrieve All Detections for the Matched ZTF Objects**\n   - For each matched ZTF object (identified by 'oid'), retrieve all corresponding detections from the 'detection' table.\n   - Join the 'ss_ztf' table (filtered by spatial match) with the 'detection' table on the 'oid' column.\n\n6. **Select the Required Columns**\n   - From the 'ss_ztf' table: select all columns (oid, candid, ssdistnr, ssmagnr, ssnamenr).\n   - From the 'detection' table: select the detection date (mjd), filter identifier (fid), isdiffpos flag, RA (ra), Dec (dec), difference magnitude (magpsf), and its uncertainty (sigmapsf).\n\n7. **Sort the Results**\n   - Sort the output first by the MPC name (ssnamenr), then by detection date (mjd).\n\n8. **Output the Results**\n   - Return the selected columns as specified, with the required sorting.\n\nSummary of Steps:\n- Define a temporary catalog with the two Solar System objects and their coordinates.\n- Use a Q3C spatial join to find all ZTF objects within 2 arcseconds of either object.\n- Join the matched ZTF objects with the 'detection' table to get all detections.\n- Select all columns from 'ss_ztf' and the specified columns from 'detection'.\n- Sort by 'ssnamenr' and 'mjd'.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''For Solar System identifiers '2003FP134' and '2009UK56', get all detections for all ZTF objects that lie within 2 arcsec from any of them.

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier' ; this will return the classifications by the light curve classifier\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n# If you need to use 2 tables, try using a INNER JOIN statement, or a sub-query over 'probability' or 'object', if the query requires it. It is important to be really careful with the use of sub-queries or JOINs, as they can slow down the query.\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Answer ONLY with the final SQL query, with the following format: \n  ```sql SQL_QUERY_HERE ```\nDON'T include anything else in your answer. If you want to add comments, use the SQL comment format inside the query.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nDecomposition Plan:\n\n1. **Identify the Main Tables and Columns:**\n   - The query requires retrieving all columns from both the 'object' and 'reference' tables.\n   - The 'object' table contains the main statistics for each ZTF object, identified by the 'oid' column.\n   - The 'reference' table contains reference image information for each object, also linked by the 'oid' column.\n\n2. **Determine the Condition for \"Change in the Reference\":**\n   - The user specifies \"objects that had a change in the reference.\"\n   - In the 'object' table, the column 'reference_change' is a boolean indicating whether the reference image changed.\n   - The query should filter for rows where 'object.reference_change' is TRUE.\n\n3. **Establish the Relationship Between Tables:**\n   - Both tables share the 'oid' column, which can be used to join them.\n   - An INNER JOIN should be used to combine rows from 'object' and 'reference' where 'object.oid = reference.oid'.\n\n4. **Select All Columns:**\n   - Since the user requests all columns from both tables, the query should select every column from both 'object' and 'reference'.\n   - To avoid ambiguity in column names (e.g., 'oid' exists in both tables), ensure the query structure allows for clear identification of columns, possibly by using table aliases or fully qualified column names.\n\n5. **Limit the Number of Results:**\n   - The user requests at most 50 rows in the result.\n   - Apply a LIMIT clause to restrict the output to 50 rows.\n\n6. **Order of Operations:**\n   - First, filter the 'object' table for 'reference_change' = TRUE.\n   - Then, join the filtered 'object' rows with the 'reference' table on 'oid'.\n   - Select all columns from both tables.\n   - Limit the result to 50 rows.\n\n7. **Summary of Steps:**\n   - Filter 'object' table for 'reference_change' = TRUE.\n   - Join filtered 'object' rows with 'reference' table on 'oid'.\n   - Select all columns from both tables.\n   - Limit the result to 50 rows.\n\nNo additional conditions or subqueries are required, as the request is straightforward and does not involve other tables or complex filtering.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Get all columns from the 'object' and 'reference' tables for ZTF objects that had a change in the reference.

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier' ; this will return the classifications by the light curve classifier\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n# If you need to use 2 tables, try using a INNER JOIN statement, or a sub-query over 'probability' or 'object', if the query requires it. It is important to be really careful with the use of sub-queries or JOINs, as they can slow down the query.\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text.

If you want to add comments, use the SQL comment format inside the query.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nDecomposition Plan:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Tables and Columns**\n   - The main tables involved are:\n     - `feature`: to filter objects by their multiband period and feature version.\n     - `probability`: to retrieve classification results for the objects.\n   - Relevant columns:\n     - From `feature`: `oid`, `name`, `value`, `version`\n     - From `probability`: all columns (since the user wants all columns from this table).\n\n2. **Set the Feature Filter Criteria**\n   - Filter the `feature` table for:\n     - `name = 'Multiband_period'`\n     - `value < 5`\n     - `version = 'lc_classifier_1.2.1-P'`\n\n3. **Set the Probability Table Filter Criteria**\n   - Filter the `probability` table for:\n     - `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'` (as per default and user request)\n     - `ranking IN (1, 2)` (user wants both top and second most likely classes)\n\n4. **Join the Tables**\n   - Join the `feature` and `probability` tables on the `oid` column to associate the filtered objects with their classification probabilities.\n\n5. **Select the Output Columns**\n   - Select all columns from the `probability` table for the matched objects.\n\n6. **Limit the Number of Results**\n   - Limit the output to at most 100 objects.\n\n7. **Ensure Uniqueness and Correctness**\n   - Since multiple probability rows per object are possible (for different classes), ensure that the limit applies to the number of objects, not rows. This may require grouping or a subquery to first select the oids, then join to probability.\n\n8. **Order of Operations**\n   - First, filter the `feature` table for the period and version.\n   - Then, select up to 100 unique `oid`s.\n   - Next, join these `oid`s to the `probability` table with the specified classifier and ranking filters.\n   - Finally, select all columns from the `probability` table for these objects.\n\nSummary of Steps:\n1. Filter `feature` for `name = 'Multiband_period'`, `value < 5`, and `version = 'lc_classifier_1.2.1-P'`.\n2. Select up to 100 unique `oid`s from this filtered set.\n3. Join these `oid`s to `probability` on `oid`.\n4. Filter `probability` for `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'` and `ranking IN (1, 2)`.\n5. Select all columns from `probability` for the resulting rows.\n6. Return the results.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Find at most 100 ZTF objects that have a multiband period lower than 5 days in the 'lc_classifier_1.2.1-P' feature version.

If you want to add comments, use the SQL comment format inside the query.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nDecomposition Plan:\n\n1. **Identify the Main Criteria and Tables:**\n   - The user wants ZTF objects (i.e., astronomical objects in the database).\n   - The main selection criterion is that the object must have a \"Multiband_period\" feature value less than 5 days.\n   - The feature must be from the 'lc_classifier_1.2.1-P' feature version.\n   - The results should return all columns from the 'probability' table.\n   - Only include rows from 'probability' where 'classifier_name' is 'lc_classifier' and 'ranking' is either 1 or 2.\n   - Limit the results to at most 100 objects.\n\n2. **Determine the Required Joins:**\n   - The 'feature' table contains the \"Multiband_period\" feature, with columns: oid, name, value, version, etc.\n   - The 'probability' table contains the classification results, with columns: oid, class_name, classifier_name, classifier_version, probability, ranking.\n   - Both tables can be joined on the 'oid' column to associate features with their classification probabilities.\n\n3. **Define the Feature Subquery:**\n   - Select oids from the 'feature' table where:\n     - name = 'Multiband_period'\n     - value < 5\n     - version = 'lc_classifier_1.2.1-P'\n   - This subquery will provide the list of oids that satisfy the period and version criteria.\n\n4. **Filter the Probability Table:**\n   - From the 'probability' table, select all columns for rows where:\n     - oid is in the set of oids from the feature subquery.\n     - classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'\n     - ranking IN (1, 2)\n\n5. **Limit the Number of Objects:**\n   - Since the user wants at most 100 objects, ensure that the query returns results for no more than 100 unique oids.\n   - If the 'probability' table contains multiple rows per oid (e.g., for different classes), ensure that the limit applies to the number of unique objects, not rows.\n\n6. **Assemble the Query Structure:**\n   - Use a subquery or a WITH clause to first select the oids from the 'feature' table that meet the period and version criteria.\n   - Join or filter the 'probability' table using these oids, applying the classifier and ranking filters.\n   - Select all columns from the 'probability' table for the final output.\n   - Apply the limit to ensure no more than 100 unique objects are returned.\n\n7. **Final Output:**\n   - The result should be all columns from the 'probability' table for up to 100 unique objects that have a multiband period less than 5 days in the specified feature version, with only the relevant classifier and ranking data included.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Find at most 100 ZTF objects that have a multiband period lower than 5 days in the 'lc_classifier_1.2.1-P' feature version.

Filter `feature` for `name = 'Multiband_period'`, `value < 5`, and `version = 'lc_classifier_1.2.1-P'`.\n   - b. Join the filtered `feature` results with `probability` on `oid`.\n   - c.

If you want to add comments, use the SQL comment format inside the query.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nDecomposition Plan:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Tables and Columns**\n   - The query requires information from the 'feature' table (to filter by multiband period and feature version) and the 'probability' table (to return classification results).\n   - The relevant columns are:\n     - From 'feature': oid, name, value, version\n     - From 'probability': all columns (oid, class_name, classifier_name, classifier_version, probability, ranking)\n\n2. **Set the Feature Filter Criteria**\n   - Filter the 'feature' table for rows where:\n     - name = 'Multiband_period'\n     - value < 5\n     - version = 'lc_classifier_1.2.1-P'\n\n3. **Extract the List of Matching Object IDs**\n   - From the filtered 'feature' table, select the 'oid' values that meet the above criteria.\n\n4. **Set the Probability Table Filter Criteria**\n   - Filter the 'probability' table for rows where:\n     - classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'\n     - ranking IN (1, 2) (i.e., ranking is either 1 or 2)\n\n5. **Join the Tables**\n   - Join the filtered 'probability' table with the list of 'oid's obtained from the 'feature' table, using the 'oid' column as the join key.\n\n6. **Limit the Number of Results**\n   - Limit the output to at most 100 objects. Since each object may have more than one row in the 'probability' table (for ranking 1 and 2), ensure that the limit applies to the number of unique objects, not just rows. This may require:\n     - First, selecting up to 100 unique 'oid's from the filtered 'feature' table.\n     - Then, joining these with the 'probability' table to get all relevant probability rows for those objects.\n\n7. **Select the Output Columns**\n   - Select all columns from the 'probability' table for the matching objects.\n\n8. **Order of Operations**\n   - The subquery or CTE should first select up to 100 unique 'oid's from the 'feature' table based on the period and version criteria.\n   - The main query should then join these 'oid's with the 'probability' table, applying the classifier and ranking filters, and return all columns from 'probability'.\n\n9. **Summary of Steps**\n   - Filter 'feature' for 'Multiband_period' < 5 and version = 'lc_classifier_1.2.1-P'.\n   - Select up to 100 unique 'oid's from this filtered set.\n   - Filter 'probability' for classifier_name = 'lc_classifier' and ranking in (1, 2).\n   - Join the two sets on 'oid'.\n   - Return all columns from 'probability' for the resulting objects.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

Filter the 'feature' table for rows where 'name' = 'Multiband_period', 'value' < 5, and 'version' = 'lc_classifier_1.2.1-P'.\n2. Extract the 'oid's from this filtered set.\n3. Join these 'oid's with the 'probability' table on 'oid'.\n4. Further filter the 'probability' table for 'classifier_name' = 'lc_classifier' and 'ranking' IN (1, 2).\n5. Select all columns from the 'probability' table for these objects.\n6. Limit the result to at most 100 unique objects (distinct 'oid's), ensuring that all relevant probability rows (for ranking 1 and 2) for each object are included.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

Create a sub-query using the 'probability' TABLE filtering the desired objects.\nII.

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier'\n### IF THE 'feature' TABLE is used with 2 or more features, you need to take the following steps, because it is a transposed table (each feature is in a different row).\nI. Create a sub-query using the 'probability' TABLE filtering the desired objects.\nII. For each feature, you have to make a sub-query retrieving the specific feature adding the condition of its value, taking only the oids in the 'probability' sub-query with an INNER JOIN inside each 'feature' sub-query to retrieve only the features associated with the desired spatial objects.\nIII. Make an UNION between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nIV. Make an INTERSECT between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nV. Filter the 'UNION' query from step III selecting only the 'oids' that are in the 'INTERSECT' query from step IV\nVI. Add the remaining conditions to the final result of step V, using the 'probability' sub-query from step I.\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\n**Decomposition Plan for the Query:**\n\n1. **Identify the Object of Interest**\n   - The user wants all photometric data for the ZTF object with identifier 'ZTF24aamtvxb'.\n   - This identifier corresponds to the 'oid' column in all relevant tables.\n\n2. **Determine the Relevant Tables and Columns**\n   - The three tables to query are: `detection`, `non_detection`, and `forced_photometry`.\n   - The required output columns are:\n     - ZTF identifier: `oid`\n     - Epoch date: `mjd`\n     - Filter identifier: `fid`\n     - isdiffpos flag: `isdiffpos`\n     - Detection difference magnitude and its uncertainty: `magpsf`, `sigmapsf` (from detection)\n     - 5-sigma magnitude limit: `diffmaglim`\n     - Forced difference magnitude and its uncertainty: `mag`, `e_mag` (from forced_photometry)\n     - Table of origin: a constant string for each subquery, e.g., 'detection', 'non_detection', 'forced_photometry'\n\n3. **Construct the Subquery for the `detection` Table**\n   - Filter rows where `oid = 'ZTF24aamtvxb'`.\n   - Select the columns:\n     - `oid` as ZTF identifier\n     - `mjd` as epoch date\n     - `fid` as filter identifier\n     - `isdiffpos`\n     - `magpsf` as detection difference magnitude\n     - `sigmapsf` as detection difference magnitude uncertainty\n     - `diffmaglim` as 5-sigma magnitude limit\n     - For forced difference magnitude and its uncertainty, set as NULL (since not present in this table)\n     - Add a constant column 'detection' as the table of origin\n\n4. **Construct the Subquery for the `non_detection` Table**\n   - Filter rows where `oid = 'ZTF24aamtvxb'`.\n   - Select the columns:\n     - `oid` as ZTF identifier\n     - `mjd` as epoch date\n     - `fid` as filter identifier\n     - For `isdiffpos`, set as NULL (not present in this table)\n     - For detection difference magnitude and its uncertainty, set as NULL (not present in this table)\n     - `diffmaglim` as 5-sigma magnitude limit\n     - For forced difference magnitude and its uncertainty, set as NULL (not present in this table)\n     - Add a constant column 'non_detection' as the table of origin\n\n5. **Construct the Subquery for the `forced_photometry` Table**\n   - Filter rows where `oid = 'ZTF24aamtvxb'`.\n   - Select the columns:\n     - `oid` as ZTF identifier\n     - `mjd` as epoch date\n     - `fid` as filter identifier\n     - `isdiffpos`\n     - For detection difference magnitude and its uncertainty, set as NULL (not present in this table)\n     - `diffmaglim` as 5-sigma magnitude limit\n     - `mag` as forced difference magnitude\n     - `e_mag` as forced difference magnitude uncertainty\n     - Add a constant column 'forced_photometry' as the table of origin\n\n6. **Unify the Results**\n   - Use a `UNION ALL` to combine the three subqueries, ensuring all epochs from all three tables are included in the output.\n   - Ensure the column order and names are consistent across all subqueries.\n\n7. **Final Output**\n   - The final result should be a single table with the following columns (in order):\n     - ZTF identifier (`oid`)\n     - Epoch date (`mjd`)\n     - Filter identifier (`fid`)\n     - isdiffpos flag (`isdiffpos`)\n     - Detection difference magnitude (`magpsf`)\n     - Detection difference magnitude uncertainty (`sigmapsf`)\n     - 5-sigma magnitude limit (`diffmaglim`)\n     - Forced difference magnitude (`mag`)\n     - Forced difference magnitude uncertainty (`e_mag`)\n     - Table of origin (`table`)\n   - Each row represents a single epoch from one of the three tables, with NULLs in columns not relevant to that table.\n\n8. **No Additional Filtering or Joins Required**\n   - Since the user only requests data for a single object and all required columns are present in the three tables, no joins or additional filtering are necessary.\n\n9. **Order of Results (Optional)**\n   - Optionally, sort the final output by `mjd` (epoch date) in ascending order for easier chronological analysis.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe query will consist of three subqueries (one for each table), each selecting the required columns (with NULLs for missing data), and a constant column indicating the table of origin. These subqueries will be combined using `UNION ALL` to produce a single unified result set. The only filter applied is `oid = 'ZTF24aamtvxb'` in each subquery. The output will include all epochs from all three tables, with the specified columns.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Find all detections, non-detections and forced photometry points for the ZTF object 'ZTF24aamtvxb'.

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier'\n### IF THE 'feature' TABLE is used with 2 or more features, you need to take the following steps, because it is a transposed table (each feature is in a different row).\nI. Create a sub-query using the 'probability' TABLE filtering the desired objects.\nII. For each feature, you have to make a sub-query retrieving the specific feature adding the condition of its value, taking only the oids in the 'probability' sub-query with an INNER JOIN inside each 'feature' sub-query to retrieve only the features associated with the desired spatial objects.\nIII. Make an UNION between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nIV. Make an INTERSECT between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nV. Filter the 'UNION' query from step III selecting only the 'oids' that are in the 'INTERSECT' query from step IV\nVI. Add the remaining conditions to the final result of step V, using the 'probability' sub-query from step I.\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nHere is a detailed decomposition plan for generating the required PostgreSQL query:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**\n- **object**: Contains ZTF object statistics.\n  - Columns needed: `oid` (ZTF identifier), `ndet` (number of detections), `firstmjd` (first detection date).\n- **probability**: Contains classification probabilities.\n  - Columns needed: `oid`, `class_name`, `classifier_name`, `classifier_version`, `probability`.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Define Filtering Conditions**\n- **Detection Count**: Only objects with `ndet > 10`.\n- **Stamp Classifier (bogus)**:\n  - `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`\n  - `classifier_version = 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'`\n  - `class_name = 'bogus'`\n  - `probability > 0.7`\n- **Light Curve Classifier Top (transient)**:\n  - `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier_top'`\n  - `class_name = 'Transient'`\n  - `probability > 0.9`\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Subquery for Objects Satisfying All Conditions**\n- **Step 3.1**: Subquery for objects with `ndet > 10` from the `object` table.\n- **Step 3.2**: Subquery for objects with `probability > 0.7` for `bogus` in the `stamp_classifier` (version 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4') from the `probability` table.\n- **Step 3.3**: Subquery for objects with `probability > 0.9` for `Transient` in the `lc_classifier_top` from the `probability` table.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Combine Subqueries Using INTERSECT**\n- **Step 4.1**: INTERSECT the oids from the three subqueries above to get objects that satisfy all conditions.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Retrieve Required Columns**\n- **Step 5.1**: For the filtered oids, join the `object` table to get `oid`, `ndet`, and `firstmjd`.\n- **Step 5.2**: Join the `probability` table twice:\n  - Once to get the `probability` for the `bogus` class in the `stamp_classifier` (version 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'), alias this as `prob_stamp_bogus`.\n  - Once to get the `probability` for the `Transient` class in the `lc_classifier_top`, alias this as `prob_lc_transient`.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Assemble the Final Query**\n- **Step 6.1**: Use INNER JOINs between the filtered oids, the `object` table, and the two relevant `probability` table entries (one for each classifier/class).\n- **Step 6.2**: Select the columns: `oid`, `ndet`, `firstmjd`, `prob_stamp_bogus`, `prob_lc_transient`.\n- **Step 6.3**: Order the results by `oid` (ZTF identifier).\n- **Step 6.4**: Limit the results to at most 30 rows.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Column Aliasing**\n- **Step 7.1**: Alias the probability columns as required:\n  - Probability from the stamp classifier as `prob_stamp_bogus`.\n  - Probability from the light curve classifier top as `prob_lc_transient`.\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Summary of Steps**\n1. Filter objects with more than 10 detections.\n2. Filter objects with probability > 0.7 of being bogus in the stamp classifier (version 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4').\n3. Filter objects with probability > 0.9 of being transient in the light curve classifier top.\n4. Find the intersection of oids from all three filters.\n5. Join the `object` table and the two relevant `probability` entries for each oid.\n6. Select and alias the required columns.\n7. Order by ZTF identifier.\n8. Limit to 30 results.\n\n---\n\nThis plan ensures all conditions are met, the correct columns are returned with the specified aliases, and the results are ordered and limited as requested.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Find at most 30 ZTF objects that satisfy the following conditions: have more than 10 detections, a probability larger than 0.7 of being a bogus in the stamp classifier version 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4', and  a probability larger than 0.9 of being a transient in the light curve classifier top level.

This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nHere is a detailed decomposition plan for generating the required PostgreSQL query:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Identify the Required Tables and Columns**\n- **object**: Contains ZTF object statistics.\n  - Columns needed: `oid` (ZTF identifier), `ndet` (number of detections), `firstmjd` (first detection date).\n- **probability**: Contains classification probabilities.\n  - Columns needed: `oid`, `class_name`, `classifier_name`, `classifier_version`, `probability`.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Define the Filtering Criteria**\n- **Detection Count**: Only objects with `ndet > 10`.\n- **Stamp Classifier (bogus)**:\n  - `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`\n  - `classifier_version = 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'`\n  - `class_name = 'bogus'`\n  - `probability > 0.7`\n- **Light Curve Classifier Top Level (transient)**:\n  - `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier_top'`\n  - `class_name = 'Transient'`\n  - `probability > 0.9`\n- **Limit**: Return at most 30 results.\n- **Order**: By ZTF identifier (`oid`) of objects classified as bogus in the stamp classifier.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Subquery for Stamp Classifier (bogus)**\n- Select `oid` and `probability` from `probability` where:\n  - `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`\n  - `classifier_version = 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'`\n  - `class_name = 'bogus'`\n  - `probability > 0.7`\n- This subquery will be used to filter objects and to retrieve the probability as `prob_stamp_bogus`.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Subquery for Light Curve Classifier Top Level (transient)**\n- Select `oid` and `probability` from `probability` where:\n  - `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier_top'`\n  - `class_name = 'Transient'`\n  - `probability > 0.9`\n- This subquery will be used to filter objects and to retrieve the probability as `prob_lc_transient`.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Find Objects Satisfying Both Classifier Conditions**\n- Use an INNER JOIN or INTERSECT between the two subqueries above on `oid` to get objects that satisfy both classifier probability conditions.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Join with the Object Table**\n- Join the result from step 5 with the `object` table on `oid` to:\n  - Filter for `ndet > 10`\n  - Retrieve `ndet` and `firstmjd` columns.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Assemble the Final Output Columns**\n- For each object, select:\n  - `oid` (ZTF identifier)\n  - `ndet` (number of detections)\n  - `firstmjd` (first detection date)\n  - `prob_stamp_bogus` (probability from stamp classifier subquery)\n  - `prob_lc_transient` (probability from light curve classifier top level subquery)\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Order and Limit the Results**\n- Order the results by `oid` (ZTF identifier) of objects classified as bogus in the stamp classifier.\n- Limit the output to 30 rows.\n\n---\n\n### 9. **Column Aliasing**\n- Ensure that the probability columns are aliased as:\n  - `prob_stamp_bogus` for the stamp classifier probability\n  - `prob_lc_transient` for the light curve classifier top level probability\n\n---\n\n### 10. **Summary of Query Structure**\n- The query will involve:\n  - Two subqueries from the `probability` table (one for each classifier condition)\n  - An INNER JOIN or INTERSECT to find objects meeting both classifier conditions\n  - A JOIN with the `object` table to apply the detection count filter and retrieve object details\n  - Selection of the required columns with appropriate aliases\n  - Ordering and limiting the results\n\n---\n\nThis step-by-step plan ensures all conditions are met, the correct columns are selected and aliased, and the query is optimized for the ALeRCE schema and requirements.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier'\n### IF THE 'feature' TABLE is used with 2 or more features, you need to take the following steps, because it is a transposed table (each feature is in a different row).\nI. Create a sub-query using the 'probability' TABLE filtering the desired objects.\nII. For each feature, you have to make a sub-query retrieving the specific feature adding the condition of its value, taking only the oids in the 'probability' sub-query with an INNER JOIN inside each 'feature' sub-query to retrieve only the features associated with the desired spatial objects.\nIII. Make an UNION between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nIV. Make an INTERSECT between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nV. Filter the 'UNION' query from step III selecting only the 'oids' that are in the 'INTERSECT' query from step IV\nVI. Add the remaining conditions to the final result of step V, using the 'probability' sub-query from step I.\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\n**Decomposition Plan for the Query:**\n\n1. **Identify the Main Tables and Columns Needed:**\n   - The main object information (ZTF identifier, number of detections, first detection date) is in the `object` table: columns `oid`, `ndet`, `firstmjd`.\n   - The classification probabilities are in the `probability` table.\n     - For the bogus probability: need `probability` where `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`, `class_name = 'bogus'`, and `classifier_version = 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'`.\n     - For the transient probability: need `probability` where `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier_top'`, `class_name = 'Transient'`.\n\n2. **Set the Required Filters:**\n   - Objects must have `ndet > 10` (from `object` table).\n   - Probability for bogus in stamp classifier must be `> 0.7` (from `probability` table, with the above classifier/class/version).\n   - Probability for transient in lc_classifier_top must be `> 0.9` (from `probability` table, with the above classifier/class).\n\n3. **Subquery for Bogus Probability:**\n   - Create a subquery from the `probability` table to select `oid` and `probability` (aliased as `prob_stamp_bogus`) where:\n     - `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`\n     - `class_name = 'bogus'`\n     - `classifier_version = 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'`\n     - `probability > 0.7`\n\n4. **Subquery for Transient Probability:**\n   - Create a subquery from the `probability` table to select `oid` and `probability` (aliased as `prob_lc_transient`) where:\n     - `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier_top'`\n     - `class_name = 'Transient'`\n     - `probability > 0.9`\n\n5. **Join the Subqueries:**\n   - INNER JOIN the two subqueries on `oid` to ensure only objects that satisfy both probability conditions are selected.\n\n6. **Join with the Object Table:**\n   - INNER JOIN the result of the previous step with the `object` table on `oid` to retrieve `ndet` and `firstmjd`.\n   - Apply the filter `ndet > 10` in this join.\n\n7. **Select the Required Columns:**\n   - Select the following columns in the final output:\n     - `object.oid` (ZTF identifier)\n     - `object.ndet` (number of detections)\n     - `object.firstmjd` (first detection date)\n     - `prob_stamp_bogus` (probability from stamp classifier)\n     - `prob_lc_transient` (probability from lc_classifier_top)\n\n8. **Order and Limit the Results:**\n   - Order the results by `object.oid` (ZTF identifier).\n   - Limit the output to at most 30 rows.\n\n9. **Summary of Steps:**\n   - Subquery 1: Select oids and bogus probability from `probability` with the stamp classifier conditions.\n   - Subquery 2: Select oids and transient probability from `probability` with the lc_classifier_top conditions.\n   - Join Subquery 1 and Subquery 2 on `oid`.\n   - Join the result with `object` on `oid` and filter for `ndet > 10`.\n   - Select the required columns, order by `oid`, and limit to 30 results.\n\n**No SQL code is provided, only the step-by-step decomposition as requested.**\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

This requires:\n     - Retrieving magmin_corr for g-band (fid=1) and r-band (fid=2) from the 'magstat' table.\n     - Calculating the absolute difference between these two values.\n   - Difference between last and first detection times (deltajd) > 20 (from 'object' table).\n   - Limit the result to at most 20 objects.\n\n3. **Determine Table Relationships and Joins:**\n   - The 'object' table is linked to 'magstat' via the 'oid' column.\n   - To get both g- and r-band magmin_corr values for each object, two subqueries or a self-join on 'magstat' filtered by fid=1 and fid=2 are needed.\n\n4. **Subquery or Join Construction:**\n   - For each object, retrieve magmin_corr where fid=1 (g-band) and magmin_corr where fid=2 (r-band) from 'magstat'.\n   - Join these values to the 'object' table using 'oid'.\n\n5. **Apply Filtering Conditions:**\n   - In the WHERE clause, set:\n     - object.ndet >= 30\n     - object.deltajd > 20\n     - The absolute difference between magmin_corr (g-band) and magmin_corr (r-band) > 3.5\n\n6. **Select Output Columns:**\n   - Select all columns from the 'object' table.\n\n7. **Limit the Number of Results:**\n   - Limit the output to 20 rows.\n\n8. **Order of Operations:**\n   - Perform the joins/subqueries to get the magmin_corr values for both bands.\n   - Apply the filtering conditions.\n   - Select all columns from 'object'.\n   - Limit the results.\n\n**Summary of Steps:**\n- Use the 'object' table as the main table.\n- Join or subquery the 'magstat' table twice (for fid=1 and fid=2) to get magmin_corr for g- and r-bands.\n- Filter objects with ndet >= 30 and deltajd > 20.\n- Filter objects where the absolute difference between magmin_corr (g-band) and magmin_corr (r-band) > 3.5.\n- Select all columns from 'object'.\n- Limit the result to 20 objects.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n# If you need to use 2 tables, try using a INNER JOIN statement, or a sub-query over 'probability' or 'object', if the query requires it. It is important to be really careful with the use of sub-queries or JOINs, as they can slow down the query.\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text.

If you want to add comments, use the SQL comment format inside the query.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\n**Decomposition Plan for the User Request:**\n\n1. **Identify the Main Table for Output:**\n   - The user wants all columns from the 'object' table for the output.\n   - The 'object' table is the main table to select from.\n\n2. **Condition 1: Minimum Number of Detections**\n   - The user specifies a minimum number of detections of 30.\n   - The relevant column in the 'object' table is 'ndet'.\n   - Add a filter: 'object.ndet >= 30'.\n\n3. **Condition 2: Difference Between Minimum g- and r-band Corrected Magnitudes > 3.5**\n   - The minimum corrected magnitude for each band is stored in the 'magstat' table, in the 'magmin_corr' column.\n   - The 'magstat' table uses 'fid' to indicate the band: 1 for g-band, 2 for r-band.\n   - For each object, retrieve the minimum corrected magnitude for g-band (fid=1) and r-band (fid=2).\n   - Calculate the absolute difference between these two values.\n   - Filter objects where this difference is greater than 3.5.\n   - This requires joining or subquerying 'magstat' twice (once for each band) and matching on 'oid'.\n\n4. **Condition 3: Difference Between Last and First Detection Times > 20 Days**\n   - The relevant columns in the 'object' table are 'lastmjd' and 'firstmjd'.\n   - Add a filter: '(object.lastmjd - object.firstmjd) > 20'.\n\n5. **Limit the Number of Results**\n   - The user requests at most 20 objects.\n   - Apply a 'LIMIT 20' clause to the query.\n\n6. **Assemble the Query Structure**\n   - The main selection is from the 'object' table.\n   - Join or use subqueries to get the minimum corrected magnitudes for g- and r-bands from 'magstat'.\n   - Apply all the above filters.\n   - Return all columns from the 'object' table.\n\n7. **Ensure Optimality and Accuracy**\n   - Use INNER JOINs or subqueries to ensure only objects with both g- and r-band data are considered.\n   - Use the exact column and table names as specified in the schema.\n   - Ensure that the difference in magnitudes is calculated as an absolute value if the user means \"difference\" in a non-directional sense.\n\n**Summary of Steps:**\n1. Select all columns from the 'object' table.\n2. Filter objects with 'ndet' >= 30.\n3. For each object, retrieve 'magmin_corr' for g-band (fid=1) and r-band (fid=2) from 'magstat'.\n4. Filter objects where the absolute difference between these two 'magmin_corr' values is greater than 3.5.\n5. Filter objects where (lastmjd - firstmjd) > 20.\n6. Limit the result to 20 objects.\n7. Ensure all joins and filters use the correct table and column names.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Get at most 20 ZTF objects that satisfy the following conditions: a minimum number of detections of 30, a difference between minimum g- and r-band corrected magnitudes larger than 3.5, and difference between last and first detection times larger than 20 days.

Create a sub-query using the 'probability' TABLE filtering the desired objects.\nII. For each feature, you have to make a sub-query retrieving the specific feature adding the condition of its value, taking only the oids in the 'probability' sub-query with an INNER JOIN inside each 'feature' sub-query to retrieve only the features associated with the desired spatial objects.\nIII. Make an UNION between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nIV. Make an INTERSECT between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nV.

Add the remaining conditions to the final result of step V, using the 'probability' sub-query from step I.\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use.

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier'\n### IF THE 'feature' TABLE is used with 2 or more features, you need to take the following steps, because it is a transposed table (each feature is in a different row).\nI. Create a sub-query using the 'probability' TABLE filtering the desired objects.\nII. For each feature, you have to make a sub-query retrieving the specific feature adding the condition of its value, taking only the oids in the 'probability' sub-query with an INNER JOIN inside each 'feature' sub-query to retrieve only the features associated with the desired spatial objects.\nIII. Make an UNION between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nIV. Make an INTERSECT between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nV. Filter the 'UNION' query from step III selecting only the 'oids' that are in the 'INTERSECT' query from step IV\nVI. Add the remaining conditions to the final result of step V, using the 'probability' sub-query from step I.\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nHere is a detailed decomposition plan for generating the required PostgreSQL query, step by step, using the ALeRCE database schema and context:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Identify Required Columns and Their Tables**\n   - **Object identifier:** `object.oid`\n   - **Candidate identifier:** `detection.candid`\n   - **Filter id (as 'f_id'):** `detection.fid`\n   - **Coordinates:** `detection.ra`, `detection.dec`\n   - **Magnitude:** `detection.magpsf`\n   - **Magnitude errors:** `detection.sigmapsf`\n   - **Corrected difference magnitude in r-band:** `detection.magpsf_corr` (for r-band, i.e., `detection.fid = 2`)\n   - **PSF corrected magnitude in r-filter:** `detection.magpsf_corr` (again, for `fid = 2`)\n   - **Maximum rise from minimum in each detection:** Need to compute, for each object, the difference between the maximum and minimum `magpsf_corr` in r-band (`fid = 2`).\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Filter Objects by Classification**\n   - Use the `probability` table to select objects where:\n     - `probability.class_name = 'CV/Nova'`\n     - `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier_stochastic'`\n     - `probability.ranking = 1` (default condition)\n   - This gives the set of oids (object identifiers) classified as CV/Nova by the stochastic light curve classifier.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Filter by Number of Detections**\n   - For each object, count the number of detections (`detection` rows) from discovery date (`object.firstmjd`) to last detection (`object.lastmjd`).\n   - Only include objects where this count is at most 50.\n   - This requires:\n     - Joining `object` and `detection` on `oid`\n     - Filtering `detection.mjd` between `object.firstmjd` and `object.lastmjd`\n     - Grouping by `object.oid` and counting detections\n     - Keeping only those with count \u2264 50\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Filter for r-band Detections**\n   - Only consider detections in the r-band: `detection.fid = 2`\n   - This applies to all magnitude and error columns, as well as the corrected magnitude.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Compute Maximum Rise from Minimum in Corrected Magnitude**\n   - For each object, in the r-band (`fid = 2`), compute:\n     - `max(detection.magpsf_corr) - min(detection.magpsf_corr)`\n   - This requires grouping detections by `object.oid` and calculating the difference.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Assemble the Final Result**\n   - For each detection (row) that meets the above criteria, select:\n     - `object.oid`\n     - `detection.candid`\n     - `detection.fid` as `f_id`\n     - `detection.ra`, `detection.dec`\n     - `detection.magpsf`\n     - `detection.sigmapsf`\n     - `detection.magpsf_corr` (corrected difference magnitude in r-band)\n     - The computed maximum rise from minimum in corrected magnitude for the object (as a column, same value for all detections of the object)\n   - Join the necessary tables: `object`, `probability`, and `detection`\n   - Apply all filters as described above\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Order and Limit the Results**\n   - Order the results by `object.oid`\n   - Limit the output to the first 1000 rows\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Detailed Subquery and Join Plan**\n   - **Step 1:** Subquery to get oids classified as CV/Nova by the stochastic classifier with ranking 1\n   - **Step 2:** Subquery to count detections per object in the r-band between discovery and last detection, filter for count \u2264 50\n   - **Step 3:** Subquery to compute, for each object, the maximum and minimum `magpsf_corr` in r-band, and their difference (maximum rise)\n   - **Step 4:** Join the above subqueries with the `detection` table (filtered for r-band) to get the required columns for each detection\n   - **Step 5:** Join with the `object` table to get discovery and last detection dates, and with the `probability` table for classification filtering\n   - **Step 6:** Select and alias columns as required, order by `object.oid`, and limit to 1000 rows\n\n---\n\n### 9. **Summary of Steps**\n   1. Filter `probability` for oids with `class_name = 'CV/Nova'`, `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier_stochastic'`, `ranking = 1`\n   2. Join with `object` to get discovery and last detection dates\n   3. Join with `detection` for r-band (`fid = 2`), filter detections between `object.firstmjd` and `object.lastmjd`\n   4. For each object, count detections in this period; keep only those with count \u2264 50\n   5. For each object, compute `max(magpsf_corr) - min(magpsf_corr)` in r-band\n   6. For each detection in r-band for these objects, select the required columns and the computed maximum rise\n   7. Order by `object.oid`, limit to 1000 rows\n\n---\n\nThis plan ensures all required filters, computations, and joins are performed in the correct order, using the optimal tables and columns, and following the database context and best practices.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Get the columns that contains: object identifier, candidate identifier, filter id as 'f_id', co-ordinates, magnitude, magnitude errors.

This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\n**Decomposition Plan for the Query:**\n\n1. **Identify Required Columns and Their Tables:**\n   - Object identifier: `object.oid`\n   - Candidate identifier: `detection.candid`\n   - Filter id (as 'f_id'): `detection.fid`\n   - Coordinates: `detection.ra`, `detection.dec`\n   - Magnitude: `detection.magpsf`\n   - Magnitude errors: `detection.sigmapsf`\n   - Corrected difference magnitude in r-band: `detection.magpsf_corr` (for r-band, i.e., `detection.fid = 2`)\n   - PSF corrected magnitude in r-filter: `detection.magpsf_corr` (for r-band)\n   - Maximum rise from minimum in each detection: Need to compute the difference between the maximum and minimum `magpsf_corr` for each object in r-band.\n\n2. **Filter Objects by Classification:**\n   - Use the `probability` table to select objects where:\n     - `probability.class_name = 'CV/Nova'`\n     - `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier_stochastic'`\n     - `probability.ranking = 1` (default condition)\n   - Join this with the `object` table to get object-level statistics.\n\n3. **Filter by Number of Detections:**\n   - The number of detections from discovery date to last detection should be at most 50.\n   - Use `object.ndet <= 50` to filter objects.\n\n4. **Filter Detections in r-band:**\n   - Only consider detections in the r-band, i.e., `detection.fid = 2`.\n\n5. **Join Tables:**\n   - Join `probability` (filtered as above) to `object` on `oid`.\n   - Join the result to `detection` on `oid` to get detection-level data.\n\n6. **Compute Maximum Rise from Minimum in Each Detection:**\n   - For each object, in the r-band, calculate the maximum and minimum `magpsf_corr` values from the `detection` table.\n   - Compute the difference (`max(magpsf_corr) - min(magpsf_corr)`) for each object.\n   - This can be done using a subquery or a window function partitioned by `oid`.\n\n7. **Select and Alias Columns:**\n   - Select the required columns, aliasing `detection.fid` as `f_id`.\n   - Include the computed maximum rise from minimum as an additional column.\n\n8. **Limit and Order Results:**\n   - Limit the result to the first 1000 rows.\n   - Order the results by `object.oid`.\n\n9. **Summary of Steps/Subqueries:**\n   - **Subquery 1:** Filter `probability` for objects classified as 'CV/Nova' by the stochastic classifier with ranking 1.\n   - **Subquery 2:** Join Subquery 1 with `object` and filter for `object.ndet <= 50`.\n   - **Subquery 3:** Join Subquery 2 with `detection` and filter for `detection.fid = 2`.\n   - **Subquery 4:** For each `oid`, compute the maximum and minimum `magpsf_corr` in r-band and their difference.\n   - **Final Selection:** Select the required columns from Subquery 3, join with Subquery 4 to add the maximum rise from minimum, limit to 1000 rows, and order by `object.oid`.\n\n10. **Ensure All Default and Explicit Conditions Are Applied:**\n    - Use all default conditions for the `probability` table as specified.\n    - Use exact column and table names as per schema.\n    - Only include detections in the r-band.\n    - Only include objects with at most 50 detections.\n\n**End of Decomposition Plan.**\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Get the columns that contains: object identifier, candidate identifier, filter id as 'f_id', co-ordinates, magnitude, magnitude errors.
