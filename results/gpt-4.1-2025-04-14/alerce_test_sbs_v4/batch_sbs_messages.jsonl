this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier'\n### IF THE 'feature' TABLE is used with 2 or more features, you need to take the following steps, because it is a transposed table (each feature is in a different row).\nI. Create a sub-query using the 'probability' TABLE filtering the desired objects.\nII. For each feature, you have to make a sub-query retrieving the specific feature adding the condition of its value, taking only the oids in the 'probability' sub-query with an INNER JOIN inside each 'feature' sub-query to retrieve only the features associated with the desired spatial objects.\nIII. Make an UNION between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nIV. Make an INTERSECT between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nV. Filter the 'UNION' query from step III selecting only the 'oids' that are in the 'INTERSECT' query from step IV\nVI. Add the remaining conditions to the final result of step V, using the 'probability' sub-query from step I.\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\n**Decomposition Plan for the User Request:**\n\n**Goal:**  \nReturn the objects classified as AGN that show variability in the r band, but have no detections or show no variability in the g band. Order the features by their value in ascending order, and the final query by oid.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Identify AGN Objects**\n\n- Use the `probability` table to select objects classified as 'AGN'.\n- Apply the default conditions:\n  - `probability.ranking = 1`\n  - `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`\n  - `probability.class_name = 'AGN'`\n- This subquery will yield the list of `oid` for AGN objects.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Define Variability in the r Band**\n\n- Use the `feature` table to identify AGN objects that show variability in the r band.\n- Variability can be inferred from features such as:\n  - `Std` (standard deviation of the light curve)\n  - `ExcessVar` (intrinsic variability amplitude)\n  - `Amplitude` (half the difference between the median of the maximum 5% and minimum 5% magnitudes)\n- For the r band, `fid = 2`.\n- Select oids from the AGN subquery (from step 1) that have a significant value in at least one of these features in the r band (e.g., `Std > 0`, `ExcessVar > 0`, or `Amplitude > 0`).\n- Create a subquery for each feature indicating variability in the r band, joining with the AGN oids.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Define No Detections or No Variability in the g Band**\n\n- For the g band, `fid = 1`.\n- \"No detections\" can be interpreted as:\n  - No entries in the `detection` table for the object with `fid = 1`\n  - Or, in the `feature` table, absence of features with `fid = 1`\n- \"No variability\" can be interpreted as:\n  - Features such as `Std`, `ExcessVar`, or `Amplitude` in the g band (`fid = 1`) are zero or below a threshold (e.g., `Std = 0`, `ExcessVar = 0`, `Amplitude = 0`)\n- For each AGN oid, check:\n  - Either there are no rows in the `feature` table for that oid with `fid = 1` and the variability features\n  - Or, if such rows exist, their values are zero or below threshold\n- This can be implemented using a NOT EXISTS or LEFT JOIN with NULL check, or by filtering out oids that have nonzero variability in the g band.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Combine r Band Variability and g Band Non-variability/No Detection**\n\n- Intersect the set of AGN oids with r band variability (from step 2) with the set of AGN oids with no g band detection or no g band variability (from step 3).\n- This yields the final list of oids matching all criteria.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Retrieve and Order Features**\n\n- For the resulting oids, retrieve all features from the `feature` table.\n- Order the features by their `value` in ascending order.\n- Order the final result by `oid` as requested.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Summary of Subqueries and Joins**\n\n- **Subquery 1:** AGN oids from `probability` table (step 1)\n- **Subquery 2:** AGN oids with r band variability (step 2)\n- **Subquery 3:** AGN oids with no g band detection or no g band variability (step 3)\n- **Final Set:** Intersection of subquery 2 and subquery 3 (step 4)\n- **Final Output:** All features for these oids, ordered by `value` (ascending) and `oid` (step 5)\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Details for Each Step**\n\n- Use INNER JOINs between `probability` and `feature` for filtering by AGN and r band variability.\n- Use LEFT JOIN or NOT EXISTS to ensure no g band detection or no g band variability.\n- Use INTERSECT to combine the sets as per the default conditions for the transposed `feature` table.\n- Use ORDER BY for both `value` (ascending) and `oid`.\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Columns to Return**\n\n- Since the user did not specify explicit columns, return all columns from the `feature` table for the selected oids.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe query will systematically:  \n- Select AGN objects (from `probability`),  \n- Filter for those with r band variability (from `feature`),  \n- Exclude those with g band detection and variability (from `feature` and/or `detection`),  \n- Retrieve all features for the resulting oids,  \n- Order the features by their value (ascending) and the final result by oid.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Return the objects classified as AGN that show variability in the r band, but have no detections or show no variability in the g band.

Add the remaining conditions to the final result of step V, using the 'probability' sub-query from step I.\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\n**Decomposition Plan for the User Request:**\n\n**Goal:**  \nReturn all objects classified as AGN (Active Galactic Nuclei) that show variability in the r band, but have no detections or show no variability in the g band. Order the features by their value in ascending order, and the final query by oid.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Identify AGN Objects**\n\n- Use the `probability` table to select objects (`oid`) classified as 'AGN'.\n- Apply the default conditions:\n  - `probability.ranking = 1`\n  - `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`\n  - `probability.class_name = 'AGN'`\n- This subquery will provide the list of oids for AGN objects.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Define Variability in the r Band**\n\n- Variability can be inferred from features in the `feature` table related to the r band (`fid = 2`).\n- Common variability indicators include:\n  - 'Std' (standard deviation of the light curve)\n  - 'ExcessVar' (intrinsic variability amplitude)\n  - 'Amplitude' (half the difference between the median of the maximum 5% and minimum 5% magnitudes)\n- For this query, select objects with a significant value in at least one of these features in the r band. For example, 'Std' > 0 or 'ExcessVar' > 0 or 'Amplitude' > 0.\n- Create a subquery for each feature in the r band (`fid = 2`), INNER JOINed with the AGN oids from step 1.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Define No Detections or No Variability in the g Band**\n\n- For the g band, `fid = 1`.\n- \"No detections\" can be checked by the feature 'n_det' (number of detections in the alert light curve of a given band) being 0 or NULL.\n- \"No variability\" can be checked by 'Std', 'ExcessVar', and 'Amplitude' being 0 or NULL in the g band.\n- Create subqueries for each of these features in the g band, INNER JOINed with the AGN oids from step 1.\n- For \"no detections,\" select oids where 'n_det' is 0 or does not exist.\n- For \"no variability,\" select oids where 'Std', 'ExcessVar', and 'Amplitude' are 0 or NULL.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Combine Variability and Non-Variability Conditions**\n\n- For the r band, UNION the oids from the subqueries for 'Std', 'ExcessVar', and 'Amplitude' where the value is > 0.\n- For the g band, INTERSECT the oids from the subqueries for 'n_det' = 0 or NULL, and 'Std', 'ExcessVar', and 'Amplitude' = 0 or NULL.\n- The final set of oids should be those that are in the r band variability set AND in the g band non-variability/no-detection set.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Retrieve and Order Features**\n\n- For the resulting oids, retrieve all features from the `feature` table.\n- Order the features by their `value` in ascending order.\n- Order the final result by `oid`.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Summary of Subqueries and Joins**\n\n- **Step 1:** Subquery for AGN oids from `probability`.\n- **Step 2:** Subqueries for r band variability features, INNER JOINed with AGN oids.\n- **Step 3:** Subqueries for g band non-variability/no-detection features, INNER JOINed with AGN oids.\n- **Step 4:** UNION and INTERSECT as per the rules for the transposed `feature` table.\n- **Step 5:** Final selection of features for the filtered oids, ordered as required.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Final Output**\n\n- The output should include all columns from the `feature` table for the selected oids, ordered by `value` (ascending) and then by `oid`.\n\n---\n\n**Note:**  \n- All table and column names must be used exactly as in the schema.\n- The query must use INNER JOINs, UNIONs, and INTERSECTs as described, following the rules for the transposed `feature` table.\n- The default probability conditions must be applied unless otherwise specified.\n- The logic for \"no detections or no variability\" in the g band must be carefully implemented to include both possibilities.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Return the objects classified as AGN that show variability in the r band, but have no detections or show no variability in the g band.

Add the remaining conditions to the final result of step V, using the 'probability' sub-query from step I.\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nHere is a detailed decomposition plan for generating the required PostgreSQL query, following the database schema, context, and advanced query requirements:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Identify AGN-classified Objects**\n\n- Start by selecting objects classified as 'AGN' using the `probability` table.\n- Apply the default conditions:\n  - `probability.ranking = 1` (most likely class)\n  - `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`\n  - `probability.class_name = 'AGN'`\n- Retrieve the corresponding `oid` values.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Define Variability in the r Band**\n\n- Variability in the r band can be inferred from features in the `feature` table.\n- Identify features that indicate variability, such as:\n  - 'Std' (standard deviation of the light curve)\n  - 'ExcessVar' (intrinsic variability amplitude)\n  - 'Amplitude' (amplitude of the light curve)\n- For the r band, `fid = 2`.\n- Select oids from the AGN set (from Step 1) that have significant values for at least one variability feature in the r band. For example, 'Std' > 0, 'ExcessVar' > 0, or 'Amplitude' > 0.\n- Use INNER JOIN between the AGN oids and the `feature` table, filtering for `fid = 2` and the relevant feature names and values.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Define No Detections or No Variability in the g Band**\n\n- For the g band, `fid = 1`.\n- \"No detections\" can be checked by the absence of relevant features or by the absence of detections in the `detection` table for `fid = 1`.\n- \"No variability\" can be checked by the variability features ('Std', 'ExcessVar', 'Amplitude') being zero or below a threshold in the g band.\n- For each AGN oid:\n  - Check if there are no rows in the `feature` table for that oid with `fid = 1` and the relevant variability features, OR\n  - If such rows exist, ensure their values are zero or below a defined threshold.\n- This requires a NOT EXISTS or LEFT JOIN ... IS NULL logic, or a subquery that excludes oids with significant variability in the g band.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Combine r-band Variability and g-band Non-variability/No Detections**\n\n- Intersect the set of AGN oids with r-band variability (Step 2) with the set of AGN oids with no g-band detections or no g-band variability (Step 3).\n- This can be achieved using an INTERSECT or by filtering the r-band variability set to exclude oids that have g-band variability.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Retrieve and Order Features**\n\n- For the resulting oids, retrieve all their features from the `feature` table.\n- Order the features by their `value` in ascending order.\n- Also, order the final result by `oid` as requested.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Detailed Subquery and Join Structure**\n\n- **Subquery 1:** Select oids classified as AGN (from Step 1).\n- **Subquery 2:** From Subquery 1, select oids with r-band variability (from Step 2).\n- **Subquery 3:** From Subquery 1, select oids with no g-band detections or no g-band variability (from Step 3).\n- **INTERSECT:** Find oids present in both Subquery 2 and Subquery 3.\n- **Final Selection:** For these oids, retrieve all features, joining with the `feature` table.\n- **ORDER BY:** Order the features by `value` ascending, and by `oid`.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Summary of Steps and Required SQL Constructs**\n\n- Use INNER JOINs to connect `probability` and `feature` tables.\n- Use subqueries to filter oids by r-band variability and g-band non-variability.\n- Use INTERSECT to combine the two filtered sets.\n- Use a final SELECT to retrieve all features for the resulting oids.\n- Use ORDER BY for both `value` (ascending) and `oid`.\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Edge Cases and Assumptions**\n\n- If \"no variability\" in g band is not strictly zero, define a small threshold (e.g., < 0.01) for variability features.\n- If \"no detections\" means no entries in the `feature` table for `fid = 1`, ensure these oids are included.\n- If the user wants all features, select all columns from the `feature` table for the final oids.\n\n---\n\nThis plan ensures the query is accurate, efficient, and follows the advanced requirements, using the correct logic for combining feature-based and classification-based filters, and handling the transposed nature of the `feature` table.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

`deltajd >= 365` (difference in days between last and first detection)\n- **Join:** INNER JOIN with the AGN `oid` list from Step 1 to restrict to relevant objects.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Select Objects with at Least 20 Detections in at Least One Band**\n- **Table:** `feature`\n- **Feature Name:** `n_det`\n- **Condition:** \n  - `value >= 20`\n- **Note:** Since `feature` is transposed, each row is a feature for an object and band.\n- **Join:** INNER JOIN with the AGN `oid` list from Step 1.\n- **Result:** List of `oid` and corresponding `fid` (filter id) where the detection count condition is met.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Select Objects with Large Variations in Corrected Magnitudes**\n#### 4.1. **Variation in g Band (fid=1) > 1 mag**\n- **Table:** `feature`\n- **Feature Names:** \n  - `min_mag` (minimum corrected magnitude in g band)\n  - `max_mag` (maximum corrected magnitude in g band)\n- **Condition:** \n  - Both features must be for `fid=1`\n  - Both features must be for the same `oid`\n- **Calculation:** \n  - Compute `delta_mag_g = max_mag - min_mag` for each `oid` in g band\n  - Condition: `delta_mag_g > 1`\n- **Join:** INNER JOIN with the AGN `oid` list from Step 1.\n\n#### 4.2. **Variation in r Band (fid=2) > 0.5 mag**\n- **Table:** `feature`\n- **Feature Names:** \n  -

Use INTERSECT to ensure only oids that satisfy all feature conditions are selected.\n  - Use UNION to collect all relevant feature rows for the selected oids.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Retrieve Required Output Columns**\n- **From `feature` Table:**\n  - `oid`\n  - `name`\n  - `value`\n  - `version`\n  - `fid` (aliased as `feature_fid`)\n- **From `object` Table:**\n  - `meanra`\n  - `meandec`\n  - `ndet`\n- **From `feature` Table (for min/max mag and delta_mag):**\n  -

All required columns as specified in Step 6.\n  - For each band, ensure the correct calculation and aliasing of `delta_mag`.\n- **Distinct:** \n  - Ensure that each row in the result corresponds to a unique combination of `oid`, `feature`, and `fid`.\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Column Aliasing**\n- **For filter id columns:** \n  - Alias as `feature_fid` (e.g., `feature.fid AS feature_fid`).\n- **For delta_mag columns:** \n  - Alias as `delta_mag`.\n\n---\n\n### 9. **Summary of Subqueries and Set Operations**\n- **Subqueries:**\n  - AGN selection (Step 1)\n  - Light curve duration (Step 2)\n  - Detection count per band (Step 3)\n  - Magnitude variation per band (Steps 4.1 and 4.2)\n- **Set Operations:**\n  - INTERSECT to enforce all feature-based conditions.\n  - UNION to collect all relevant feature rows for the selected oids.\n\n---\n\n### 10. **Ensure Optimal Query Structure**\n- **Indexes:** \n  - Use indexed columns for joins and filtering (`oid`, `class_name`, `ranking`, `classifier_name`, `value`, `fid`).\n- **Avoid:** \n  - Filtering on non-indexed columns in large tables unless necessary.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe query will first select AGN objects with high probability, then filter for those with long-duration light curves, sufficient detections in any band, and large corrected magnitude variations in both g and r bands. It will then retrieve all required feature and object information, using appropriate joins, subqueries, INTERSECTs, and UNIONs, and apply the specified column aliasing.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier'\n### IF THE 'feature' TABLE is used with 2 or more features, you need to take the following steps, because it is a transposed table (each feature is in a different row).\nI. Create a sub-query using the 'probability' TABLE filtering the desired objects.\nII. For each feature, you have to make a sub-query retrieving the specific feature adding the condition of its value, taking only the oids in the 'probability' sub-query with an INNER JOIN inside each 'feature' sub-query to retrieve only the features associated with the desired spatial objects.\nIII. Make an UNION between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nIV. Make an INTERSECT between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nV. Filter the 'UNION' query from step III selecting only the 'oids' that are in the 'INTERSECT' query from step IV\nVI. Add the remaining conditions to the final result of step V, using the 'probability' sub-query from step I.\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nHere is a detailed decomposition plan for generating the required PostgreSQL query, following the database schema, context, and advanced query requirements:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Identify AGN Objects with High Classification Probability**\n- **Table:** `probability`\n- **Conditions:**\n  - `class_name = 'AGN'`\n  - `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`\n  - `ranking = 1` (default condition)\n  - `probability > 0.6`\n- **Output:** List of `oid` for objects classified as AGN with the required probability.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Filter Objects with Light Curves Covering at Least One Year**\n- **Table:** `object`\n- **Join:** Use the `oid` from Step 1.\n- **Condition:** \n  - `deltajd >= 365` (light curve covers at least one year)\n- **Output:** List of `oid` that satisfy both AGN classification and time coverage.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Select Objects with at Least 20 Detections in at Least One Band**\n- **Table:** `feature`\n- **Feature Name:** `n_det`\n- **Condition:** \n  - `value >= 20`\n- **Join:** Only consider `oid` from Step 2.\n- **Output:** List of `oid` that have at least one band with 20 or more detections.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Select Objects with Required Magnitude Variations in g and r Bands**\n#### 4.1. **g Band: Variation > 1 mag (Corrected)**\n- **Table:** `feature`\n- **Feature Name:** `delta_mag_fid`\n- **Band:** `fid = 1` (g band)\n- **Condition:** \n  - `value > 1`\n- **Join:** Only consider `oid` from Step 3.\n\n#### 4.2. **r Band: Variation > 0.5 mag (Corrected)**\n- **Table:** `feature`\n- **Feature Name:** `delta_mag_fid`\n- **Band:** `fid = 2` (r band)\n- **Condition:** \n  - `value > 0.5`\n- **Join:** Only consider `oid` from Step 3.\n\n#### 4.3. **Combine g and r Band Variation Conditions**\n- **Method:** \n  - For the transposed `feature` table, create two subqueries (one for each band/condition).\n  - Use an `INTERSECT` to get `oid` present in both subqueries (i.e., objects meeting both g and r band variation requirements).\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Aggregate All Filters to Get Final List of oids**\n- **Method:** \n  - The final list of `oid` is the intersection of all previous steps (AGN classification, time coverage, detection count, and both magnitude variation conditions).\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Retrieve Required Output Columns**\n#### 6.1. **From `feature` Table**\n- **Columns:** `oid`, `name`, `value`, `version`, `fid` (aliased as `feature_fid`)\n- **Condition:** \n  - Only include features for the final list of `oid` from Step 5.\n\n#### 6.2. **From `object` Table**\n- **Columns:** \n  - `meanra`, `meandec` (mean coordinates)\n  - `ndet` (total number of detections)\n- **Join:** On `oid` from Step 5.\n\n#### 6.3. **From `feature` Table for Magnitude Statistics**\n- **Feature Names:** \n  - `min_mag` and `max_mag` for both g (`fid=1`) and r (`fid=2`) bands.\n- **Columns:** \n  - For each band, retrieve `min_mag` and `max_mag` values, their `version`, and `fid` (aliased as `feature_fid`).\n- **Join:** Only for `oid` from Step 5.\n\n#### 6.4. **Calculate Magnitude Variations (delta_mag)**\n- **Method:** \n  - For each band, compute `delta_mag = max_mag - min_mag`.\n  - Alias the result as `delta_mag` for each band.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Assemble the Final Output**\n- **Columns to Return:**\n  - `oid`\n  - `name` (from `feature`)\n  - `value` (from `feature`)\n  - `version` (from `feature`)\n  - `feature_fid` (from `feature`)\n  - `meanra` (from `object`)\n  - `meandec` (from `object`)\n  - `ndet` (from `object`)\n  - `min_mag` and `max_mag` (from `feature` for both bands)\n  - `delta_mag` (computed for both bands)\n- **Method:** \n  - Use appropriate `JOIN`s to combine data from `object` and `feature` tables for the selected `oid`s.\n  - Ensure that the `feature` table is joined multiple times as needed to retrieve different features (e.g., `min_mag`, `max_mag`, `delta_mag_fid`, `n_det`).\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Apply Aliases and Formatting**\n- **Alias `fid` columns as `feature_fid` in the output.**\n- **Alias the computed magnitude difference as `delta_mag`.**\n- **Ensure all columns are selected as per the user\u2019s request.**\n\n---\n\n### 9. **(Optional) Order or Group Results**\n- **If required, group by `oid` or order by a relevant column (e.g., `oid` or `delta_mag`).**\n\n---\n\n### 10. **Summary of Subqueries and Joins**\n- **Subquery 1:** Select `oid` from `probability` with AGN, probability > 0.6, ranking=1, classifier_name='lc_classifier'.\n- **Subquery 2:** Filter those `oid` in `object` with `deltajd >= 365`.\n- **Subquery 3:** Filter those `oid` in `feature` with `name='n_det'` and `value >= 20`.\n- **Subquery 4:** Filter those `oid` in `feature` with `name='delta_mag_fid'`, `fid=1`, `value > 1`.\n- **Subquery 5:** Filter those `oid` in `feature` with `name='delta_mag_fid'`, `fid=2`, `value > 0.5`.\n- **INTERSECT** subqueries 4 and 5 to get objects with required variations in both bands.\n- **Final Join:** Use the resulting `oid` to join with `object` and `feature` tables to retrieve all requested columns, including calculation of `delta_mag` for each band.\n\n---\n\nThis plan ensures all advanced requirements are met, using the correct logic for the transposed `feature` table, and applies all necessary filters and joins for optimal and accurate query construction.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Get all the objects classified as AGN with a probability larger than 0.6, with light curves covering at least one year that have at least 20 detections at least in one band, and select those that show variations larger than 1 magnitude in the g band and larger than 0.5 in the r band.

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier'\n### IF THE 'feature' TABLE is used with 2 or more features, you need to take the following steps, because it is a transposed table (each feature is in a different row).\nI. Create a sub-query using the 'probability' TABLE filtering the desired objects.\nII. For each feature, you have to make a sub-query retrieving the specific feature adding the condition of its value, taking only the oids in the 'probability' sub-query with an INNER JOIN inside each 'feature' sub-query to retrieve only the features associated with the desired spatial objects.\nIII. Make an UNION between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nIV. Make an INTERSECT between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nV. Filter the 'UNION' query from step III selecting only the 'oids' that are in the 'INTERSECT' query from step IV\nVI. Add the remaining conditions to the final result of step V, using the 'probability' sub-query from step I.\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nHere is a detailed decomposition plan for generating the required PostgreSQL query, following the database schema, context, and advanced query requirements:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Identify AGN Objects with High Classification Probability**\n- **Table:** `probability`\n- **Conditions:**\n  - `class_name = 'AGN'`\n  - `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`\n  - `ranking = 1` (default condition)\n  - `probability > 0.6`\n- **Output:** List of `oid` for objects classified as AGN with high confidence.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Filter Objects with Light Curves Covering at Least One Year**\n- **Table:** `object`\n- **Condition:** \n  - `deltajd >= 365` (since `deltajd` is the time difference in days between last and first detection)\n- **Join:** \n  - INNER JOIN with the AGN `oid` list from Step 1 to restrict to AGN candidates.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Select Objects with at Least 20 Detections in at Least One Band**\n- **Table:** `feature`\n- **Feature Name:** `n_det`\n- **Condition:** \n  - `value >= 20`\n- **Note:** \n  - This must be true for at least one band (i.e., at least one row per `oid` with `name = 'n_det'` and `value >= 20`).\n- **Join:** \n  - INNER JOIN with the AGN `oid` list from Step 1.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Select Objects with Large Variations in Corrected Magnitudes**\n#### 4.1. **Variation in g Band**\n- **Table:** `feature`\n- **Feature Names:** \n  - `min_mag` (minimum magnitude in band)\n  - `max_mag` (maximum magnitude in band)\n- **Band:** \n  - `fid = 1` (g band)\n- **Condition:** \n  - The difference between `max_mag` and `min_mag` (i.e., `max_mag - min_mag`) must be greater than 1.\n- **Note:** \n  - Only consider features where the magnitudes are corrected (as per the user request).\n- **Join:** \n  - INNER JOIN with the AGN `oid` list from Step 1.\n\n#### 4.2. **Variation in r Band**\n- **Table:** `feature`\n- **Feature Names:** \n  - `min_mag`\n  - `max_mag`\n- **Band:** \n  - `fid = 2` (r band)\n- **Condition:** \n  - The difference between `max_mag` and `min_mag` (i.e., `max_mag - min_mag`) must be greater than 0.5.\n- **Note:** \n  - Only consider features where the magnitudes are corrected.\n- **Join:** \n  - INNER JOIN with the AGN `oid` list from Step 1.\n\n#### 4.3. **Combine Variation Conditions**\n- **Requirement:** \n  - The same `oid` must satisfy both the g band and r band variation conditions.\n- **Method:** \n  - Use INTERSECT between the sets of `oid` from 4.1 and 4.2.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Combine All Filters**\n- **Method:** \n  - The final set of `oid` must satisfy all of the following:\n    - AGN classification with high probability (Step 1)\n    - Light curve duration >= 1 year (Step 2)\n    - At least 20 detections in at least one band (Step 3)\n    - Satisfy both g and r band variation conditions (Step 4, via INTERSECT)\n- **Implementation:** \n  - Use subqueries and INTERSECT/INNER JOINs as needed to ensure all conditions are met.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Retrieve Required Output Columns**\n- **From `feature` Table:**\n  - For each selected `oid`, retrieve:\n    - `value`, `name`, `version`, `fid` (aliased as `feature_fid`)\n- **From `object` Table:**\n  - For each selected `oid`, retrieve:\n    - `oid`\n    - `meanra`, `meandec` (mean coordinates)\n    - `ndet` (number of detections)\n- **From `feature` Table (again):**\n  - For each selected `oid`, retrieve:\n    - `max_mag` and `min_mag` for both g (`fid=1`) and r (`fid=2`) bands, with their respective `fid` values (aliased as `feature_fid`)\n    - Compute `delta_mag` for each band as `max_mag - min_mag`, aliasing the result as `delta_mag`\n- **Note:** \n  - Ensure that the `max_mag` and `min_mag` values are the corrected ones, as per the user request.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Assemble the Final Output**\n- **Columns to Return:**\n  - `oid`\n  - `value`, `name`, `version`, `feature_fid` (from `feature`)\n  - `meanra`, `meandec` (from `object`)\n  - `ndet` (from `object`)\n  - `max_mag`, `min_mag` (from `feature` for both bands)\n  - `delta_mag` (computed for both bands)\n- **Grouping/Joining:**\n  - Join the relevant tables/subqueries on `oid` to assemble all required columns for each object.\n  - Ensure that the output includes the required aliases for filter id columns (`feature_fid`).\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Summary of Query Structure**\n- **Subquery 1:** Select AGN oids with high probability from `probability`.\n- **Subquery 2:** Filter those oids for light curve duration >= 1 year in `object`.\n- **Subquery 3:** Filter those oids for at least one band with `n_det >= 20` in `feature`.\n- **Subquery 4:** Filter those oids for g band variation > 1 mag in `feature`.\n- **Subquery 5:** Filter those oids for r band variation > 0.5 mag in `feature`.\n- **INTERSECT:** Between subqueries 4 and 5 to get oids satisfying both variation conditions.\n- **Final Join:** Combine all filters to get the final set of oids.\n- **Select:** For these oids, retrieve all required columns from `object` and `feature`, compute `delta_mag` for both bands, and apply the required column aliases.\n\n---\n\nThis step-by-step plan ensures all user requirements are met, using the correct tables, columns, and advanced SQL constructs (JOINs, INTERSECTs, subqueries, and computed columns) as required by the complexity of the request and the database schema.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Get all the objects classified as AGN with a probability larger than 0.6, with light curves covering at least one year that have at least 20 detections at least in one band, and select those that show variations larger than 1 magnitude in the g band and larger than 0.5 in the r band.

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier'\n### IF THE 'feature' TABLE is used with 2 or more features, you need to take the following steps, because it is a transposed table (each feature is in a different row).\nI. Create a sub-query using the 'probability' TABLE filtering the desired objects.\nII. For each feature, you have to make a sub-query retrieving the specific feature adding the condition of its value, taking only the oids in the 'probability' sub-query with an INNER JOIN inside each 'feature' sub-query to retrieve only the features associated with the desired spatial objects.\nIII. Make an UNION between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nIV. Make an INTERSECT between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nV. Filter the 'UNION' query from step III selecting only the 'oids' that are in the 'INTERSECT' query from step IV\nVI. Add the remaining conditions to the final result of step V, using the 'probability' sub-query from step I.\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nHere is a detailed decomposition plan for generating the required PostgreSQL query, step by step, using the ALeRCE database schema and all the provided context and constraints:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Identify the Main Selection Table and Columns**\n- The main table for object identifiers is `object` (column: `oid`).\n- The `probability` table is needed for classification probabilities (for both 'stamp_classifier' and 'lc_classifier').\n- The `detection` table is needed to find the first detection (for date and magnitude).\n- The `non_detection` table is needed to find the last non-detection before the first detection (for magnitude limit).\n- The `magstat` table is needed for the filter ID and to estimate the initial rise.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Filter Objects with First Detection in the First 2 Days of September**\n- Use the `object` table to get `oid`.\n- Use the `firstmjd` column in `object` to filter for objects with `firstmjd >= 60188.0` and `firstmjd < 60190.0`.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Determine Fast Riser Status**\n- For each object, in each filter:\n  - Find the first detection in the `detection` table (minimum `mjd` for each `oid`, `fid`).\n  - For that detection, get the `magpsf` (or `magpsf_corr` if corrected).\n  - Find the last non-detection in the `non_detection` table for the same `oid` and `fid`, with `mjd` less than the first detection's `mjd` (maximum `mjd` less than first detection).\n  - Get the `diffmaglim` from the last non-detection.\n  - Calculate the time difference (`dt = detection.mjd - non_detection.mjd`).\n  - Calculate the magnitude difference (`dm = non_detection.diffmaglim - detection.magpsf`).\n  - Calculate the rate: `dmdt = dm / dt`.\n  - Select only those where `dmdt >= 0.25`.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Filter for Highest Probability in Stamp Classifier for Class 'SN'**\n- Use the `probability` table:\n  - Filter for `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`.\n  - Filter for `class_name = 'SN'`.\n  - For each `oid`, select the row with the highest probability (i.e., `ranking = 1`).\n- Only keep objects where the highest probability class in the stamp classifier is 'SN'.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Retrieve Probabilities in Stamp Classifier and Light Curve Classifier**\n- For each selected `oid`:\n  - Get the probability for `class_name = 'SN'` and `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'` (with `ranking = 1`).\n  - Get the probability for `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'` (with `ranking = 1`), regardless of class.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Retrieve Non-Detections (Light Curve) for Each Object**\n- For each selected `oid`, retrieve all rows from `non_detection` (i.e., the light curve consisting only of non-detections).\n- Include `oid`, `fid`, `mjd`, and `diffmaglim`.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Retrieve magstat Information for Initial Rise Estimate**\n- For each selected `oid` and filter (`fid`), retrieve from `magstat`:\n  - `oid`, `fid` (as `magstat_fid`), and any relevant columns for the initial rise estimate (e.g., `dmdt_first`).\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Assemble the Final Output Columns**\n- For each qualifying object, output:\n  - `oid`\n  - Probability in stamp classifier (`probability` table, `class_name = 'SN'`, `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`)\n  - Probability in light curve classifier (`probability` table, `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`)\n  - For each non-detection: `fid`, `mjd`, `diffmaglim`\n  - For each magstat: `magstat_fid` (i.e., `magstat.fid`), `dmdt_first` (initial rise estimate)\n\n---\n\n### 9. **Join and Subquery Structure**\n- Start with a subquery to select `oid` from `object` with `firstmjd` in the required range.\n- Join to a subquery that filters for fast risers (using `detection` and `non_detection` as described).\n- Join to `probability` for the stamp classifier (with `class_name = 'SN'`, `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`, `ranking = 1`).\n- Join to `probability` for the light curve classifier (`classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`, `ranking = 1`).\n- Join to `non_detection` for the light curve.\n- Join to `magstat` for the initial rise estimate.\n- Use appropriate ON conditions for `oid` and `fid` as needed.\n\n---\n\n### 10. **Ordering and Limiting**\n- Order the final results by `oid`.\n- Limit the output to 100 rows.\n\n---\n\n### 11. **Summary of Steps/Subqueries**\n1. Subquery: Select `oid` from `object` where `firstmjd` is in the first 2 days of September.\n2. Subquery: For each `oid` and `fid`, find first detection and last non-detection, compute `dmdt`, filter for `dmdt >= 0.25`.\n3. Subquery: For each `oid`, select from `probability` where `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`, `class_name = 'SN'`, `ranking = 1`.\n4. Subquery: For each `oid`, select from `probability` where `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`, `ranking = 1`.\n5. Join: For each qualifying `oid`, join to `non_detection` to get all non-detections.\n6. Join: For each qualifying `oid` and `fid`, join to `magstat` to get `magstat_fid` and `dmdt_first`.\n7. Assemble: Select required columns from all joined tables.\n8. Order by `oid`, limit to 100 rows.\n\n---\n\n### 12. **Notes and Caveats**\n- Ensure that all joins are INNER JOINs to enforce that only objects meeting all criteria are included.\n- If an object has multiple filters qualifying, each combination should be included.\n- If an object has multiple non-detections, each should be included (i.e., the result may have multiple rows per object).\n- Use aliases for clarity in the final SELECT.\n\n---\n\nThis plan ensures all user requirements are met, using the correct tables, columns, and logic, and is structured for optimal and accurate query generation.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier' ; this will return the classifications by the light curve classifier\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n# If you need to use 2 tables, try using a INNER JOIN statement, or a sub-query over 'probability' or 'object', if the query requires it. It is important to be really careful with the use of sub-queries or JOINs, as they can slow down the query.\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Answer ONLY with the final SQL query, with the following format: \n  ```sql SQL_QUERY_HERE ```\nDON'T include anything else in your answer. If you want to add comments, use the SQL comment format inside the query.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\n**Decomposition Plan for the User Request:**\n\n1. **Identify the Required Columns and Their Tables:**\n   - From the user request, the following columns are needed:\n     - Unique object identifier: `oid` (from `detection` and `ps1_ztf`)\n     - Candidate identifier: `candid` (from `detection`)\n     - Filter identifier: `fid` (from `detection`)\n     - Modified Julian Date: `mjd` (from `detection`)\n     - Magnitude: `magpsf` (from `detection`)\n     - Magnitude error: `sigmapsf` (from `detection`)\n     - Whether the object has stamps: `has_stamp` (from `detection`)\n     - Deep learning real bogus score: `drb` (from `detection`)\n     - Star galaxy score of the nearest object: `sgscore1` (from `ps1_ztf`)\n     - Distance to the nearest source in Pan-STARRS: `distpsnr1` (from `ps1_ztf`)\n\n2. **Define the List of OIDs to Filter:**\n   - The query should only consider the following oids:\n     - 'ZTF23aavzgjg', 'ZTF23aaynzyk', 'ZTF23aavqxos', 'ZTF23aaknyni', 'ZTF23aavsdtc', 'ZTF18aandkua', 'ZTF23aaxfewt', 'ZTF23aavshwi', 'ZTF22aawasao', 'ZTF23aaxgvnt'\n   - This will be implemented as a filter: `oid IN (...)`\n\n3. **Apply the Deep Learning Real Bogus Score Condition:**\n   - Only include detections where `drb > 0.5`.\n\n4. **Apply the Star Galaxy Score and Distance Conditions:**\n   - Only include detections where either:\n     - `sgscore1 < 0.5`\n     - OR `distpsnr1 < 1`\n   - These columns are from the `ps1_ztf` table.\n\n5. **Determine the Table Relationships and Joins:**\n   - The main table is `detection` (contains most of the required columns).\n   - The `ps1_ztf` table contains the Pan-STARRS crossmatch information (`sgscore1`, `distpsnr1`).\n   - Both tables can be joined on `oid` and `candid` (as `ps1_ztf` has both columns and is keyed on them).\n\n6. **Construct the Join:**\n   - Use an INNER JOIN between `detection` and `ps1_ztf` on both `oid` and `candid` to ensure that only detections with Pan-STARRS crossmatch information are included.\n\n7. **Select the Required Columns:**\n   - In the SELECT clause, include all the columns listed in step 1 from their respective tables.\n\n8. **Assemble the WHERE Clause:**\n   - Combine all the filtering conditions:\n     - OID in the provided list.\n     - `drb > 0.5`\n     - (`sgscore1 < 0.5` OR `distpsnr1 < 1`)\n\n9. **No Additional Aggregation or Sorting Required:**\n   - The user did not request aggregation or a specific order, so return the results as is.\n\n10. **Summary of Steps:**\n    - Start from the `detection` table.\n    - INNER JOIN with `ps1_ztf` on `oid` and `candid`.\n    - Filter for oids in the provided list.\n    - Filter for `drb > 0.5`.\n    - Filter for (`sgscore1 < 0.5` OR `distpsnr1 < 1`).\n    - Select the specified columns from both tables.\n\n**This plan ensures all user requirements are met, using the correct columns, relationships, and optimal filtering.**\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''For the next list of oids: ['ZTF23aavzgjg' 'ZTF23aaynzyk' 'ZTF23aavqxos' 'ZTF23aaknyni'\n 'ZTF23aavsdtc' 'ZTF18aandkua' 'ZTF23aaxfewt' 'ZTF23aavshwi'\n 'ZTF22aawasao' 'ZTF23aaxgvnt'], return the unique object identifier, candidate identifier, filter identifier, modified julian date, magnitud, magnitud error, whether the object has stamps, deep learning real bogus score, the star galaxy score of the nearest object, and the distance to the nearest source in panstarrs for objects that have a deep learning real bogus score greater than 0.5 and that either have a star galaxy score less than 0.5 or a distance to the nearest panstarrs source smaller than 1 arcsec.''"}], "max_completion_tokens": 4000, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "n": 1}}

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier'\n### IF THE 'feature' TABLE is used with 2 or more features, you need to take the following steps, because it is a transposed table (each feature is in a different row).\nI. Create a sub-query using the 'probability' TABLE filtering the desired objects.\nII. For each feature, you have to make a sub-query retrieving the specific feature adding the condition of its value, taking only the oids in the 'probability' sub-query with an INNER JOIN inside each 'feature' sub-query to retrieve only the features associated with the desired spatial objects.\nIII. Make an UNION between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nIV. Make an INTERSECT between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nV. Filter the 'UNION' query from step III selecting only the 'oids' that are in the 'INTERSECT' query from step IV\nVI. Add the remaining conditions to the final result of step V, using the 'probability' sub-query from step I.\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nHere is a detailed decomposition plan for generating the required PostgreSQL query:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**\n   - **object**: Contains the main statistics for each ZTF object (oid is the primary key).\n   - **probability**: Contains classification probabilities for each object (oid, class_name, classifier_name, probability, ranking).\n   - **ps1_ztf**: Contains information about the three closest Pan-STARRS sources for each object (oid, distpsnr1 is the distance to the nearest PS1 source).\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Define Filtering Conditions**\n   - **Distance to Nearest PS1 Source**: Only select objects where `ps1_ztf.distpsnr1 > 5`.\n   - **Probability Condition**: Only select objects where:\n     - `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'` (default condition).\n     - `probability.ranking = 1` (default condition).\n     - `probability.probability > 0.7`.\n     - `probability.class_name` is NOT a supernova class. Supernova classes in 'lc_classifier' are: 'SNIa', 'SNIbc', 'SNII', 'SLSN'. So, exclude these.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Determine Required Output**\n   - Return **all columns** from the `object`, `probability`, and `ps1_ztf` tables for the selected objects.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Establish Table Relationships and Joins**\n   - All three tables are related via the `oid` column.\n   - Use INNER JOINs to combine:\n     - `object` with `probability` on `oid`.\n     - The result with `ps1_ztf` on `oid`.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Apply Filtering in the Query**\n   - In the JOINed result, apply the following WHERE conditions:\n     - `ps1_ztf.distpsnr1 > 5`\n     - `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`\n     - `probability.ranking = 1`\n     - `probability.probability > 0.7`\n     - `probability.class_name NOT IN ('SNIa', 'SNIbc', 'SNII', 'SLSN')`\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Order and Limit the Results**\n   - Order the results by `ps1_ztf.distpsnr1` (ascending, as default).\n   - Limit the number of results to 200.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Summary of Steps/Subqueries**\n   1. **Subquery 1**: Select all oids from `probability` where:\n      - `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`\n      - `ranking = 1`\n      - `probability > 0.7`\n      - `class_name NOT IN ('SNIa', 'SNIbc', 'SNII', 'SLSN')`\n   2. **Subquery 2**: Join the result of Subquery 1 with `object` on `oid`.\n   3. **Subquery 3**: Join the result of Subquery 2 with `ps1_ztf` on `oid`.\n   4. **Final Filtering**: In the joined result, filter for `ps1_ztf.distpsnr1 > 5`.\n   5. **Select All Columns**: From the joined tables, select all columns from `object`, `probability`, and `ps1_ztf`.\n   6. **Order and Limit**: Order by `ps1_ztf.distpsnr1` and limit to 200 results.\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Additional Notes**\n   - Ensure that the query returns only unique objects (if there is a possibility of duplicates due to multiple entries in `ps1_ztf` or `probability`).\n   - If there are multiple `ps1_ztf` entries per `oid`, ensure that only the relevant (e.g., latest or first) entry is selected, or clarify if all should be included.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe query will use INNER JOINs between `object`, `probability`, and `ps1_ztf` on `oid`, filter for the specified probability and distance conditions, exclude supernova classes, select all columns from the three tables, order by the nearest PS1 source distance, and limit the output to 200 objects.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Find at most 200 ZTF objects that satisfy the following conditions: have a distance to the nearest PS1 source larger than 5 arcsec, and have a probability larger than 0.7 of being in a class other than supernova in the light curve classifier.

Create a sub-query using the 'probability' TABLE filtering the desired objects.\nII. For each feature, you have to make a sub-query retrieving the specific feature adding the condition of its value, taking only the oids in the 'probability' sub-query with an INNER JOIN inside each 'feature' sub-query to retrieve only the features associated with the desired spatial objects.\nIII. Make an UNION between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nIV. Make an INTERSECT between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nV. Filter the 'UNION' query from step III selecting only the 'oids' that are in the 'INTERSECT' query from step IV\nVI. Add the remaining conditions to the final result of step V, using the 'probability' sub-query from step I.\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nHere is a detailed decomposition plan for generating the required PostgreSQL query:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Identify the Main Tables and Columns Involved**\n   - The main tables required are:\n     - `object`: contains the main statistics for each ZTF object.\n     - `probability`: contains classification probabilities for each object.\n     - `ps1_ztf`: contains information about the nearest Pan-STARRS (PS1) sources for each ZTF object.\n   - The relevant columns are:\n     - From `ps1_ztf`: `distpsnr1` (distance to the nearest PS1 source).\n     - From `probability`: `probability`, `class_name`, `classifier_name`, `ranking`.\n     - From `object`: all columns (as per instructions).\n     - From `ps1_ztf`: all columns (as per instructions).\n     - From `probability`: all columns (as per instructions).\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Set Up the Required Filters and Conditions**\n   - **PS1 Distance Condition:** Only select objects where `ps1_ztf.distpsnr1 > 5`.\n   - **Probability Table Default Conditions:**\n     - `probability.ranking = 1` (most likely class).\n     - `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'` (light curve classifier).\n   - **Probability Value Condition:** `probability.probability > 0.7`.\n   - **Class Exclusion Condition:** Exclude supernova classes. The supernova classes in `lc_classifier` are: `'SNIa'`, `'SNIbc'`, `'SNII'`, `'SLSN'`. So, `probability.class_name NOT IN ('SNIa', 'SNIbc', 'SNII', 'SLSN')`.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Determine the Required Joins**\n   - Join `object` and `ps1_ztf` on `oid`.\n   - Join `object` and `probability` on `oid`.\n   - Alternatively, join all three tables on `oid` (since all are related by this key).\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Select the Required Columns**\n   - Select all columns from `object`, `probability`, and `ps1_ztf`.\n   - This can be achieved by using `SELECT object.*, probability.*, ps1_ztf.*`.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Apply the Row Limit and Sorting**\n   - Limit the result to at most 200 rows.\n   - Order the results by `ps1_ztf.distpsnr1` (distance to the nearest PS1 source), in ascending order (so the smallest qualifying distances come first).\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Detailed Step-by-Step Plan**\n1. **Subquery for Probability Filtering:**\n   - Create a subquery on the `probability` table to select all `oid` where:\n     - `probability.ranking = 1`\n     - `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'`\n     - `probability.probability > 0.7`\n     - `probability.class_name NOT IN ('SNIa', 'SNIbc', 'SNII', 'SLSN')`\n   - This subquery will return the oids and all columns from `probability` for objects that are most likely (rank 1) to be a non-supernova class with probability > 0.7.\n\n2. **Join with Object Table:**\n   - Join the result of the probability subquery with the `object` table on `oid` to retrieve all object columns for the filtered oids.\n\n3. **Join with PS1_ZTF Table:**\n   - Join the result of the previous step with the `ps1_ztf` table on `oid` to retrieve all PS1 matching columns.\n\n4. **Apply PS1 Distance Filter:**\n   - Add a condition to only include rows where `ps1_ztf.distpsnr1 > 5`.\n\n5. **Select All Columns:**\n   - In the final SELECT statement, include all columns from `object`, `probability`, and `ps1_ztf`.\n\n6. **Order and Limit:**\n   - Order the results by `ps1_ztf.distpsnr1` in ascending order.\n   - Limit the output to 200 rows.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Summary of Logical Flow**\n- Start with a subquery filtering the `probability` table for non-supernova, high-probability, rank 1, light curve classifier results.\n- Join this subquery with the `object` table to get all object details.\n- Join the result with the `ps1_ztf` table to get PS1 matching information.\n- Filter for objects with a nearest PS1 source distance greater than 5 arcsec.\n- Select all columns from all three tables.\n- Order by the nearest PS1 source distance and limit to 200 results.\n\n---\n\nThis plan ensures all required conditions are met, the correct columns are selected, and the query is both accurate and optimal for the ALeRCE database schema.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Find at most 200 ZTF objects that satisfy the following conditions: have a distance to the nearest PS1 source larger than 5 arcsec, and have a probability larger than 0.7 of being in a class other than supernova in the light curve classifier.

If not, assume that the 'oid' in 'magstat' and 'probability' can be joined to the appropriate cross-match or mapping to 'allwise'.\n   - For this plan, assume there is a way to join ZTF oids to allwise oids, possibly via a cross-match table (e.g., 'xmatch').\n\n4. **Construct the Subqueries and Joins:**\n   - First, filter the 'probability' table for objects with the required AGN probability and classifier conditions.\n   - Join the filtered 'probability' results to the 'magstat' table using 'oid'.\n   - Join the resulting set to the 'allwise' table (via the cross-match table if necessary) to access the W1 magnitude.\n   - Filter the joined results for the W1 magnitude range.\n\n5. **Apply the Result Limit:**\n   - Limit the final result to at most 50 objects.\n\n6. **Return the Required Columns:**\n   - Ensure that all columns from the 'magstat' table are included in the output.\n\n7. **Summary of Steps:**\n   - a. Filter 'probability' for class_name = 'AGN', classifier_name = 'lc_classifier', ranking = 1, and probability > 0.6.\n   - b. Join the filtered 'probability' results to 'magstat' on 'oid'.\n   - c. Join the above result to 'allwise' (via cross-match if needed) to access 'w1mpro'.\n   - d. Filter for 12 <= w1mpro <= 13.\n   - e. Select all columns from 'magstat' for the resulting objects.\n   - f. Limit the output to 50 rows.\n\n8. **Assumptions and Notes:**\n   - If a cross-match table is required to relate ZTF oids to allwise oids, include it in the join logic.\n   - If multiple 'magstat' rows exist per object (e.g., for different bands), all matching rows should be returned.\n   - If the user wants only unique objects, consider grouping or distinct selection as needed.\n\nThis step-by-step plan ensures the query will accurately and efficiently retrieve the requested information from the ALeRCE database.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier' ; this will return the classifications by the light curve classifier\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n# If you need to use 2 tables, try using a INNER JOIN statement, or a sub-query over 'probability' or 'object', if the query requires it. It is important to be really careful with the use of sub-queries or JOINs, as they can slow down the query.\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Answer ONLY with the final SQL query, with the following format: \n  ```sql SQL_QUERY_HERE ```\nDON'T include anything else in your answer. If you want to add comments, use the SQL comment format inside the query.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nDecomposition Plan:\n\n1. **Identify the Main Output Table and Columns:**\n   - The user wants all columns from the 'magstat' table for the selected objects.\n   - The final SELECT statement should retrieve all columns from 'magstat'.\n\n2. **Determine the Filtering Criteria:**\n   - Objects must have a probability > 0.6 of being classified as 'AGN' by the light curve classifier.\n   - The probability table must be filtered for:\n     - class_name = 'AGN'\n     - classifier_name = 'lc_classifier' (default condition)\n     - ranking = 1 (default condition)\n     - probability > 0.6\n   - Objects must have a WISE W1 magnitude (w1mpro) between 12 and 13.\n   - The W1 magnitude is in the 'allwise' table, column 'w1mpro', and the range is 12 <= w1mpro <= 13.\n\n3. **Establish Table Relationships and Joins:**\n   - The 'magstat' table contains ZTF object information, keyed by 'oid'.\n   - The 'probability' table is also keyed by 'oid' and provides classification probabilities.\n   - The 'allwise' table is keyed by 'oid_catalog', which is not the same as the ZTF 'oid'. To relate ZTF objects to ALLWISE, you need to use the 'xmatch' table (not shown in the schema above, but implied by the context and standard ALeRCE schema), which links ZTF 'oid' to 'oid_catalog' in 'allwise'.\n   - Therefore, you need to join:\n     - 'magstat' to 'probability' on 'oid'\n     - 'magstat' (or 'probability') to 'xmatch' on 'oid'\n     - 'xmatch' to 'allwise' on 'oid_catalog'\n\n4. **Apply Filtering Conditions:**\n   - In the join with 'probability', filter for:\n     - class_name = 'AGN'\n     - classifier_name = 'lc_classifier'\n     - ranking = 1\n     - probability > 0.6\n   - In the join with 'allwise', filter for:\n     - w1mpro >= 12 AND w1mpro <= 13\n\n5. **Limit the Number of Results:**\n   - The user requests at most 50 objects, so apply a LIMIT 50 clause to the query.\n\n6. **Summary of Steps/Subqueries:**\n   - Subquery or join to select oids from 'probability' that meet the AGN, classifier, ranking, and probability conditions.\n   - Join these oids to 'xmatch' to get the corresponding 'oid_catalog' for ALLWISE.\n   - Join 'oid_catalog' to 'allwise' to filter for W1 magnitude between 12 and 13.\n   - Join the resulting oids to 'magstat' to retrieve all columns for those objects.\n   - Limit the output to 50 rows.\n\n7. **Ensure Optimality and Accuracy:**\n   - Use INNER JOINs to ensure only objects meeting all criteria are returned.\n   - Use the correct column and table names as specified in the schema.\n   - Apply all default and user-specified conditions precisely.\n\n8. **Final Output:**\n   - The query should return all columns from 'magstat' for up to 50 ZTF objects that:\n     - Have a probability > 0.6 of being an AGN (class_name = 'AGN', classifier_name = 'lc_classifier', ranking = 1) in the 'probability' table.\n     - Have a WISE W1 magnitude (w1mpro) between 12 and 13 in the 'allwise' table, joined via the 'xmatch' table.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Find at most 50 ZTF objects that satisfy the following conditions: have a probability larger than 0.6 of being an AGN in the light curve classifier, and a WISE W1 magnitude between 12 and 13.

If you want to add comments, use the SQL comment format inside the query.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nDecomposition Plan:\n\n1. **Identify the Main Output Table and Columns:**\n   - The user wants all columns from the 'magstat' table for the selected objects.\n   - Therefore, the main SELECT will be from the 'magstat' table.\n\n2. **Determine the Filtering Criteria:**\n   - Objects must have a probability > 0.6 of being an AGN according to the light curve classifier.\n   - The probability table contains classification probabilities, so this is the source for this filter.\n   - The relevant conditions for the 'probability' table are:\n     - class_name = 'AGN'\n     - classifier_name = 'lc_classifier' (as per default)\n     - ranking = 1 (as per default)\n     - probability > 0.6\n\n3. **Establish the Relationship Between Tables:**\n   - The 'magstat' table contains an 'oid' column (object identifier).\n   - The 'probability' table also contains an 'oid' column.\n   - The 'allwise' table contains WISE photometry, with 'oid_catalog' as the identifier.\n   - To connect ZTF objects (from 'magstat' and 'probability') to WISE photometry, a cross-match is needed based on sky position (RA, Dec).\n   - The 'magstat' table does not have RA/Dec, but the 'object' table (not shown in the schema above, but referenced) likely contains RA/Dec for ZTF objects.\n   - The cross-match will be performed between the ZTF object's RA/Dec and the 'allwise' table's RA/Dec using a Q3C spatial join.\n\n4. **Define the WISE Magnitude Filter:**\n   - The 'allwise' table contains the W1 magnitude in the 'w1mpro' column.\n   - The filter is: w1mpro BETWEEN 12 AND 13.\n\n5. **Limit the Number of Results:**\n   - The user requests at most 50 objects, so a LIMIT 50 clause will be applied.\n\n6. **Plan the Query Structure:**\n   - Start by filtering the 'probability' table for AGN, ranking=1, classifier_name='lc_classifier', and probability > 0.6.\n   - Join the filtered 'probability' table to the 'magstat' table using the 'oid' column.\n   - Join the 'magstat' (or 'probability') table to the 'object' table to obtain RA/Dec for each ZTF object.\n   - Perform a Q3C spatial join between the ZTF object's RA/Dec and the 'allwise' table's RA/Dec to find the nearest WISE source.\n   - Filter the 'allwise' table for w1mpro BETWEEN 12 AND 13.\n   - Select all columns from 'magstat' for the resulting objects.\n   - Limit the output to 50 rows.\n\n7. **Order of Operations and Optimization:**\n   - Apply the most restrictive filters first (probability and W1 magnitude) to minimize the number of objects to cross-match.\n   - Use INNER JOINs to ensure only objects meeting all criteria are returned.\n   - Use Q3C's spatial join function (e.g., q3c_join or q3c_radial_query) for efficient cross-matching between ZTF and WISE positions.\n\n8. **Summary of Steps:**\n   - Filter 'probability' for AGN, ranking=1, classifier_name='lc_classifier', probability > 0.6.\n   - Join to 'magstat' on 'oid'.\n   - Join to 'object' on 'oid' to get RA/Dec.\n   - Perform a Q3C spatial join between 'object' (RA, Dec) and 'allwise' (ra, dec).\n   - Filter 'allwise' for w1mpro BETWEEN 12 AND 13.\n   - Select all columns from 'magstat'.\n   - Limit to 50 results.\n\n9. **Assumptions:**\n   - The 'object' table exists and contains 'oid', 'ra', and 'dec' columns.\n   - The Q3C extension is available for spatial joins.\n   - The cross-match radius is not specified; a reasonable default (e.g., 2 arcseconds) should be used.\n\n10. **Final Output:**\n    - The query will return all columns from the 'magstat' table for up to 50 ZTF objects that are most likely AGN (by the light curve classifier, with probability > 0.6), and are spatially matched to a WISE source with W1 magnitude between 12 and 13.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Find at most 50 ZTF objects that satisfy the following conditions: have a probability larger than 0.6 of being an AGN in the light curve classifier, and a WISE W1 magnitude between 12 and 13.

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier' ; this will return the classifications by the light curve classifier\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n# If you need to use 2 tables, try using a INNER JOIN statement, or a sub-query over 'probability' or 'object', if the query requires it. It is important to be really careful with the use of sub-queries or JOINs, as they can slow down the query.\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Answer ONLY with the final SQL query, with the following format: \n  ```sql SQL_QUERY_HERE ```\nDON'T include anything else in your answer. If you want to add comments, use the SQL comment format inside the query.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\n**Decomposition Plan for the User Request:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**\n   - The main object identifier is in the `object` table (`oid`).\n   - The candidate identifier is in the `detection` table (`candid`).\n   - The probability and classification information is in the `probability` table (`probability`).\n   - Information about the nearest Solar System object is in the `ss_ztf` table (`ssdistnr`, `ssmagnr`, `ssnamenr`).\n   - The filter identifier is in the `detection` table (`fid`).\n   - The FWHM from SExtractor, number of PS1 calibrators, and exposure time are not present in the provided schema. If these are present in another table or as additional columns in `detection`, they should be included; otherwise, note their absence.\n   \n2. **Set Filtering Conditions:**\n   - Only consider objects classified as 'asteroid' by the `stamp_classifier`.\n   - Use only the classifier version 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'.\n   - Only include rows where the probability is greater than 0.9.\n   - Only include the most likely class per object (`probability.ranking = 1`).\n   - Limit the result to at most 30 objects.\n\n3. **Determine Required Joins:**\n   - Join `probability` to `object` using `oid` to get the ZTF object identifier.\n   - Join `detection` to `object` using `oid` to get candidate-specific information.\n   - Join `ss_ztf` to `object` using `oid` to get Solar System object information.\n\n4. **Select Required Columns:**\n   - ZTF object identifier: `object.oid`\n   - Candidate identifier: `detection.candid`\n   - Distance from nearest Solar System object: `ss_ztf.ssdistnr`\n   - MPC archive magnitude: `ss_ztf.ssmagnr`\n   - Name of nearest Solar System object: `ss_ztf.ssnamenr`\n   - Filter identifier: `detection.fid`\n   - FWHM from SExtractor: (Check if available in `detection` or another table; if not, note its absence)\n   - Number of PS1 calibrators used: (Check if available in `detection` or another table; if not, note its absence)\n   - Exposure time: (Check if available in `detection` or another table; if not, note its absence)\n\n5. **Apply Sorting and Limiting:**\n   - Limit the output to 30 rows.\n   - No specific sorting is requested, so default order is acceptable unless otherwise specified.\n\n6. **Check for Missing Columns:**\n   - If FWHM from SExtractor, number of PS1 calibrators, or exposure time are not present in the schema, acknowledge that these columns cannot be included unless additional tables or schema details are provided.\n\n7. **Assemble the Query Structure:**\n   - Use an INNER JOIN between `probability`, `object`, `detection`, and `ss_ztf` on `oid`.\n   - Apply the filtering conditions in the WHERE clause.\n   - Select the required columns.\n   - Limit the result to 30 rows.\n\n8. **Final Output:**\n   - The output table should contain the columns: ZTF object identifier, candidate identifier, distance from nearest Solar System object, MPC archive magnitude, name of nearest Solar System object, filter identifier, and (if available) FWHM from SExtractor, number of PS1 calibrators, and exposure time.\n\n**Note:** If the FWHM, number of PS1 calibrators, or exposure time are not present in the provided schema, these cannot be included in the output. If they are present in another table, an additional join will be required.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Find at most 30 ZTF objects that have a probability larger than 0.9 of being an asteroid in the stamp classifier version 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'.

If not, note that it cannot be included.)\n   - Number of PS1 calibrators used: (This is not present in the provided schema; check if it is available in any table. If not, note that it cannot be included.)\n   - Exposure time: (This is not present in the provided schema; check if it is available in any table. If not, note that it cannot be included.)\n\n3. **Establish Table Relationships and Joins:**\n   - Start from the `probability` table to select objects meeting the classification and probability criteria.\n   - Join with the `object` table using `probability.oid = object.oid` to get the object identifier.\n   - Join with the `ss_ztf` table using `object.oid = ss_ztf.oid` to get Solar System object information.\n   - Join with the `detection` table using `object.oid = detection.oid` to get candidate and filter information.\n   - If there are multiple detections per object, decide whether to select the first, last, or all detections per object. (If not specified, select all detections for each object.)\n\n4. **Apply the Result Limitation:**\n   - Limit the total number of returned rows to 30.\n\n5. **Select and Alias the Output Columns:**\n   - In the SELECT clause, include:\n     - `object.oid` as ZTF object identifier\n     - `detection.candid` as candidate identifier\n     - `ss_ztf.ssdistnr` as distance from nearest Solar System object\n     - `ss_ztf.ssmagnr` as MPC archive magnitude\n     - `ss_ztf.ssnamenr` as name of nearest Solar System object\n     - `detection.fid` as filter identifier\n   - Note: FWHM from SExtractor, number of PS1 calibrators, and exposure time are not present in the provided schema and cannot be included unless they exist in a table not described here.\n\n6. **Order and Grouping (if needed):**\n   - If the user wants the \"top\" 30 objects, consider ordering by probability descending.\n   - If multiple detections per object are possible and only one per object is desired, group by object and select a representative detection (e.g., the one with the earliest or latest MJD).\n\n7. **Final Output:**\n   - The query should return at most 30 rows, each containing the requested columns, with the specified filtering and joining logic.\n\n**Summary of Steps:**\n1. Filter the `probability` table for objects classified as 'asteroid' by 'stamp_classifier' version 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4' with probability > 0.9.\n2. Join with the `object` table to get the ZTF object identifier.\n3. Join with the `ss_ztf` table to get Solar System object information (distance, magnitude, name).\n4. Join with the `detection` table to get candidate and filter information.\n5. Select the required columns for output.\n6. Limit the result to 30 rows.\n7.

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier'\n### IF THE 'feature' TABLE is used with 2 or more features, you need to take the following steps, because it is a transposed table (each feature is in a different row).\nI. Create a sub-query using the 'probability' TABLE filtering the desired objects.\nII. For each feature, you have to make a sub-query retrieving the specific feature adding the condition of its value, taking only the oids in the 'probability' sub-query with an INNER JOIN inside each 'feature' sub-query to retrieve only the features associated with the desired spatial objects.\nIII. Make an UNION between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nIV. Make an INTERSECT between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nV. Filter the 'UNION' query from step III selecting only the 'oids' that are in the 'INTERSECT' query from step IV\nVI. Add the remaining conditions to the final result of step V, using the 'probability' sub-query from step I.\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nTo generate a PostgreSQL query that retrieves at most 10 ZTF objects meeting the specified conditions and returns the requested columns, follow this detailed decomposition plan:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**\n- **object**: Contains ZTF object statistics, including:\n  - `oid` (ZTF identifier)\n  - `ndet` (number of detections)\n  - `firstmjd` (first detection date)\n  - `lastmjd` (last detection date)\n- **probability**: Contains classification probabilities, including:\n  - `oid` (ZTF identifier)\n  - `class_name` (should be 'asteroid')\n  - `classifier_name` (should be 'stamp_classifier')\n  - `classifier_version` (should be 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4')\n  - `probability` (probability value)\n- **ss_ztf**: Contains Solar System object cross-match info, including:\n  - `oid` (ZTF identifier)\n  - `candid` (candidate identifier)\n  - `ssdistnr` (distance to nearest Solar System object, in arcsec)\n  - `ssnamenr` (MPC name)\n- **detection**: Contains detection events, including:\n  - `candid` (candidate identifier)\n  - `oid` (ZTF identifier)\n  - `mjd` (detection date)\n  - `fid` (filter identifier)\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Define Filtering Conditions**\n- **object**: `ndet > 500`\n- **probability**:\n  - `class_name = 'asteroid'`\n  - `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`\n  - `classifier_version = 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'`\n  - `probability > 0.5`\n- **ss_ztf**: `ssdistnr < 2`\n- **Limit**: At most 10 results\n- **Order**: By `firstmjd` (first detection date)\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Determine Required Output Columns**\n- ZTF identifier: `object.oid`\n- Number of detections: `object.ndet`\n- First detection date: `object.firstmjd`\n- Last detection date: `object.lastmjd`\n- Probability: `probability.probability`\n- Candidate identifier: `ss_ztf.candid`\n- Distance between ZTF object and MPC object: `ss_ztf.ssdistnr`\n- MPC name: `ss_ztf.ssnamenr`\n- Detection date: `detection.mjd`\n- Filter identifier: `detection.fid`\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Plan Table Joins and Subqueries**\n- **Step 1:** Filter the `object` table for `ndet > 500`.\n- **Step 2:** Filter the `probability` table for the specified asteroid classification and probability, joining on `oid`.\n- **Step 3:** Filter the `ss_ztf` table for `ssdistnr < 2`, joining on `oid`.\n- **Step 4:** Join the `detection` table on `oid` and `candid` to get detection date and filter identifier for the candidate matched in `ss_ztf`.\n- **Step 5:** Combine all filters using INNER JOINs to ensure only objects meeting all criteria are included.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Detailed Step-by-Step Decomposition**\n1. **Subquery for Filtered Objects:**\n   - Select from `object` where `ndet > 500`.\n\n2. **Subquery for Filtered Probabilities:**\n   - Select from `probability` where:\n     - `class_name = 'asteroid'`\n     - `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`\n     - `classifier_version = 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'`\n     - `probability > 0.5`\n   - Join with the filtered `object` subquery on `oid`.\n\n3. **Subquery for Filtered Solar System Cross-matches:**\n   - Select from `ss_ztf` where `ssdistnr < 2`.\n   - Join with the result of the previous step on `oid`.\n\n4. **Join with Detection Table:**\n   - Join the result of the previous step with `detection` on both `oid` and `candid` to get the detection date (`mjd`) and filter identifier (`fid`) for the candidate matched in `ss_ztf`.\n\n5. **Select Required Columns:**\n   - From the joined tables, select:\n     - `object.oid`\n     - `object.ndet`\n     - `object.firstmjd`\n     - `object.lastmjd`\n     - `probability.probability`\n     - `ss_ztf.candid`\n     - `ss_ztf.ssdistnr`\n     - `ss_ztf.ssnamenr`\n     - `detection.mjd`\n     - `detection.fid`\n\n6. **Order and Limit:**\n   - Order the results by `object.firstmjd` (ascending).\n   - Limit the output to 10 rows.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Summary of Query Structure**\n- Use INNER JOINs between `object`, `probability`, `ss_ztf`, and `detection` on the appropriate keys.\n- Apply all filtering conditions in the WHERE clause or ON conditions of the JOINs.\n- Select only the requested columns.\n- Order by `object.firstmjd` and limit to 10 results.\n\n---\n\nThis step-by-step plan ensures all conditions are met, the correct columns are returned, and the query is both accurate and efficient.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier'\n### IF THE 'feature' TABLE is used with 2 or more features, you need to take the following steps, because it is a transposed table (each feature is in a different row).\nI. Create a sub-query using the 'probability' TABLE filtering the desired objects.\nII. For each feature, you have to make a sub-query retrieving the specific feature adding the condition of its value, taking only the oids in the 'probability' sub-query with an INNER JOIN inside each 'feature' sub-query to retrieve only the features associated with the desired spatial objects.\nIII. Make an UNION between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nIV. Make an INTERSECT between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nV. Filter the 'UNION' query from step III selecting only the 'oids' that are in the 'INTERSECT' query from step IV\nVI. Add the remaining conditions to the final result of step V, using the 'probability' sub-query from step I.\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nTo generate a PostgreSQL query that retrieves at most 10 ZTF objects meeting the specified conditions and returns the requested columns, follow this detailed decomposition plan:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**\n- **object**: Contains ZTF object statistics, including:\n  - `oid` (ZTF identifier)\n  - `ndet` (number of detections)\n  - `firstmjd` (first detection date)\n  - `lastmjd` (last detection date)\n- **probability**: Contains classification probabilities, including:\n  - `oid` (ZTF identifier)\n  - `class_name` (should be 'asteroid')\n  - `classifier_name` (should be 'stamp_classifier')\n  - `classifier_version` (should be 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4')\n  - `probability` (probability value)\n- **ss_ztf**: Contains Solar System object cross-match info, including:\n  - `oid` (ZTF identifier)\n  - `candid` (candidate identifier)\n  - `ssdistnr` (distance to nearest Solar System object, in arcsec)\n  - `ssnamenr` (MPC name)\n- **detection**: Contains detection events, including:\n  - `candid` (candidate identifier)\n  - `oid` (ZTF identifier)\n  - `mjd` (detection date)\n  - `fid` (filter identifier)\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Define Filtering Conditions**\n- **object.ndet > 500**: Only objects with more than 500 detections.\n- **probability.class_name = 'asteroid'**\n- **probability.classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'**\n- **probability.classifier_version = 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'**\n- **probability.probability > 0.5**\n- **ss_ztf.ssdistnr < 2**: Distance to nearest Solar System object below 2 arcsec.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Determine Required Columns for Output**\n- ZTF identifier: `object.oid`\n- Number of detections: `object.ndet`\n- First detection date: `object.firstmjd`\n- Last detection date: `object.lastmjd`\n- Probability: `probability.probability`\n- Candidate identifier: `ss_ztf.candid`\n- Distance between ZTF object and MPC object: `ss_ztf.ssdistnr`\n- MPC name: `ss_ztf.ssnamenr`\n- Detection date: `detection.mjd`\n- Filter identifier: `detection.fid`\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Plan Table Joins and Subqueries**\n- **Join `object` and `probability`** on `oid` to filter objects by detection count and probability conditions.\n- **Join the result with `ss_ztf`** on `oid` to filter by Solar System object distance and retrieve candidate/MPC info.\n- **Join with `detection`** on `oid` and `candid` to get detection date and filter identifier for the specific candidate.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Apply Sorting and Limiting**\n- **Order by `object.firstmjd`** (first detection date).\n- **Limit results to 10**.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Detailed Step-by-Step Decomposition**\n\n#### Step 1: Filter `object` table\n- Select objects with `ndet > 500`.\n\n#### Step 2: Filter `probability` table\n- Select rows where:\n  - `class_name = 'asteroid'`\n  - `classifier_name = 'stamp_classifier'`\n  - `classifier_version = 'stamp_classifier_1.0.4'`\n  - `probability > 0.5`\n\n#### Step 3: Join `object` and `probability`\n- Inner join on `oid` to get objects that satisfy both detection and probability conditions.\n\n#### Step 4: Filter and Join with `ss_ztf`\n- Inner join the result with `ss_ztf` on `oid`.\n- Filter where `ssdistnr < 2`.\n\n#### Step 5: Join with `detection`\n- Inner join with `detection` on both `oid` and `candid` to get detection date and filter identifier for the candidate associated with the Solar System object.\n\n#### Step 6: Select Required Columns\n- From the joined tables, select:\n  - `object.oid`\n  - `object.ndet`\n  - `object.firstmjd`\n  - `object.lastmjd`\n  - `probability.probability`\n  - `ss_ztf.candid`\n  - `ss_ztf.ssdistnr`\n  - `ss_ztf.ssnamenr`\n  - `detection.mjd`\n  - `detection.fid`\n\n#### Step 7: Order and Limit\n- Order the results by `object.firstmjd` (ascending).\n- Limit the output to 10 rows.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Summary of Query Structure**\n- The query will use multiple INNER JOINs between `object`, `probability`, `ss_ztf`, and `detection`.\n- Filtering will be applied at each join step to ensure only objects meeting all criteria are included.\n- The final SELECT will include all requested columns.\n- Results will be ordered and limited as specified.\n\n---\n\nThis step-by-step plan ensures all conditions are met, the correct columns are returned, and the query is both accurate and efficient.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

This can be done using the q3c_join or q3c_radial_query function in the WHERE or JOIN ON clause.\n\n7. **Assemble the Query Structure**\n   - Use an INNER JOIN (or a WHERE clause with q3c_radial_query) between 'object' and 'allwise' based on the spatial proximity of their coordinates.\n   - Select the required columns as specified above.\n\n8. **Return All Columns if Not Explicitly Specified**\n   - Since the user did not request additional columns, only the specified columns need to be returned.\n\nSummary of Steps:\n- Filter 'object' for 'oid' = 'ZTF19aascdol'.\n- Spatially join 'object' to 'allwise' using Q3C functions to find matches within a small radius.\n- Calculate the angular distance between the ZTF object and each ALLWISE match.\n- Select and return: ZTF object identifier, ALLWISE identifier, distance, and WISE W1\u2013W4 magnitudes.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier' ; this will return the classifications by the light curve classifier\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n# If you need to use 2 tables, try using a INNER JOIN statement, or a sub-query over 'probability' or 'object', if the query requires it. It is important to be really careful with the use of sub-queries or JOINs, as they can slow down the query.\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Answer ONLY with the final SQL query, with the following format: \n  ```sql SQL_QUERY_HERE ```\nDON'T include anything else in your answer. If you want to add comments, use the SQL comment format inside the query.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nDecomposition Plan for the User Request:\n\n1. **Identify the ZTF Object of Interest**\n   - The user specifies the ZTF object identifier: 'ZTF19aascdol'.\n   - This identifier corresponds to the 'oid' column in the 'object' table.\n\n2. **Find the ALLWISE Counterpart(s) for the ZTF Object**\n   - Determine how the ZTF object is matched to ALLWISE sources.\n   - If there is a cross-match table (not explicitly listed in the schema above), it would typically link 'object.oid' (ZTF) to 'allwise.oid_catalog' (ALLWISE).\n   - If such a table is not available, perform a positional cross-match using the coordinates from the 'object' table (meanra, meandec) and the 'allwise' table (ra, dec).\n   - Use the Q3C extension's spatial join function (e.g., q3c_join or q3c_radial_query) to find ALLWISE sources within a reasonable matching radius (e.g., 3 arcseconds, which is 0.0008333 degrees) of the ZTF object's position.\n\n3. **Retrieve Identifiers**\n   - For each match, retrieve:\n     - The ZTF object identifier ('object.oid').\n     - The ALLWISE catalog identifier ('allwise.oid_catalog').\n\n4. **Calculate the Angular Distance Between Counterparts**\n   - For each matched pair, calculate the angular distance between the ZTF object's position ('object.meanra', 'object.meandec') and the ALLWISE source's position ('allwise.ra', 'allwise.dec').\n   - Use the Q3C function q3c_dist to compute this distance in degrees.\n\n5. **Retrieve WISE Magnitudes**\n   - For each matched ALLWISE source, retrieve the magnitudes in the WISE W1 to W4 filters:\n     - 'allwise.w1mpro', 'allwise.w2mpro', 'allwise.w3mpro', 'allwise.w4mpro'.\n\n6. **Assemble the Output Columns**\n   - The final output should include:\n     - ZTF object identifier ('object.oid')\n     - ALLWISE catalog identifier ('allwise.oid_catalog')\n     - Angular distance between the ZTF and ALLWISE positions (computed value)\n     - WISE W1 magnitude ('allwise.w1mpro')\n     - WISE W2 magnitude ('allwise.w2mpro')\n     - WISE W3 magnitude ('allwise.w3mpro')\n     - WISE W4 magnitude ('allwise.w4mpro')\n\n7. **Apply Filtering and Output**\n   - Ensure the query only returns results for the specified ZTF object ('ZTF19aascdol').\n   - If multiple ALLWISE matches are found within the matching radius, return all matches.\n\n8. **(Optional) Order or Limit Results**\n   - Optionally, order the results by angular distance (ascending) to show the closest match first.\n\nSummary of Steps:\n- Filter the 'object' table for 'oid' = 'ZTF19aascdol'.\n- Use the coordinates from this object to perform a spatial cross-match with the 'allwise' table using Q3C functions.\n- For each match, select the required identifiers, compute the angular distance, and retrieve the WISE magnitudes.\n- Return all relevant columns for each match.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: Note that filters W1 to W4 means returning W1, W2, W3 and W4\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''For the ZTF object 'ZTF19aascdol' get the following information about its ALLWISE match(es): identifier in ZTF and in the catalog, distance between counterparts, and magnitudes in filters WISE W1 to W4''"}], "max_completion_tokens": 4000, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "n": 1}}

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier' ; this will return the classifications by the light curve classifier\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n# If you need to use 2 tables, try using a INNER JOIN statement, or a sub-query over 'probability' or 'object', if the query requires it. It is important to be really careful with the use of sub-queries or JOINs, as they can slow down the query.\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Answer ONLY with the final SQL query, with the following format: \n  ```sql SQL_QUERY_HERE ```\nDON'T include anything else in your answer. If you want to add comments, use the SQL comment format inside the query.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\n**Decomposition Plan for the User Request:**\n\n1. **Define the Solar System Objects of Interest**\n   - Identify the two Solar System object identifiers: '2003FP134' and '2009UK56'.\n   - These correspond to the 'ssnamenr' column in the 'ss_ztf' table.\n\n2. **Retrieve Positions of the Solar System Objects**\n   - For each of the two identifiers, obtain their celestial coordinates (RA, Dec).\n   - Since the ALeRCE schema does not provide a direct table for Solar System object coordinates, assume that the user will provide these coordinates, or that they are available from an external source.\n   - For the query, define a temporary table (using a WITH clause) named 'catalog' with columns: source_id, ra, dec, containing the MPC names and their respective coordinates.\n\n3. **Find ZTF Objects Near the Solar System Objects**\n   - Use the Q3C extension to perform a cone search for all ZTF objects (from the 'ss_ztf' table) whose (ra, dec) are within 2 arcseconds (2/3600 degrees) of any of the Solar System object positions in the 'catalog' table.\n   - The 'ss_ztf' table does not have RA/Dec columns, so you need to join it with a table that contains the coordinates of the ZTF objects. The most likely candidate is the 'detection' table, which has 'ra' and 'dec' columns for each detection.\n   - The join should be performed between the 'catalog' table and the 'detection' table using the Q3C radial query function, with a radius of 2 arcseconds.\n\n4. **Link Detections to Solar System Objects**\n   - For each detection that matches the spatial criteria, join with the 'ss_ztf' table to retrieve all columns from 'ss_ztf' for the corresponding 'oid' and 'candid'.\n   - Ensure that the 'ssnamenr' in 'ss_ztf' matches either '2003FP134' or '2009UK56'.\n\n5. **Select Required Columns**\n   - From the 'ss_ztf' table: select all columns.\n   - From the 'detection' table: select 'mjd' (detection date), 'fid' (filter identifier), 'isdiffpos' (isdiffpos flag), 'ra', 'dec', 'magpsf' (difference magnitude), and 'sigmapsf' (its uncertainty).\n\n6. **Sort the Results**\n   - Sort the results first by 'ssnamenr' (MPC name) and then by 'mjd' (detection date).\n\n7. **Summary of Steps**\n   - a. Create a temporary 'catalog' table with the two Solar System objects and their coordinates.\n   - b. Join 'catalog' with 'detection' using Q3C radial query for 2 arcseconds.\n   - c. Join the result with 'ss_ztf' on 'oid' and 'candid'.\n   - d. Filter for 'ssnamenr' in ('2003FP134', '2009UK56').\n   - e. Select all columns from 'ss_ztf' and the specified columns from 'detection'.\n   - f. Sort by 'ssnamenr' and 'mjd'.\n\n**Note:** If the coordinates for the Solar System objects are not available in the database, they must be provided by the user or obtained from an external source and included in the 'catalog' CTE.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''For Solar System identifiers '2003FP134' and '2009UK56', get all detections for all ZTF objects that lie within 2 arcsec from any of them.

Since each object may have up to two rows in the 'probability' table (for ranking 1 and 2), ensure the limit applies to the number of objects, not rows. This may require grouping or a subquery to select up to 100 unique oids, then retrieving all their associated probability rows.\n\n8. **Assemble the Query**\n   - Combine all the above steps into a single query, ensuring the logic flows from filtering features, selecting oids, filtering probability rows, and limiting the result to 100 unique objects.\n\n9. **Review for Optimality and Accuracy**\n   - Ensure that the query uses indexes efficiently (e.g., on oid, ranking, classifier_name).\n   - Confirm that all user requirements and default conditions are met.\n   - Double-check that all table and column names match the schema exactly.\n\n10. **Document the Query Logic**\n    - Optionally, add comments or documentation to clarify each step and the rationale for the filters and joins used.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Find at most 100 ZTF objects that have a multiband period lower than 5 days in the 'lc_classifier_1.2.1-P' feature version.

This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n# If you need to use 2 tables, try using a INNER JOIN statement, or a sub-query over 'probability' or 'object', if the query requires it.

If multiple probability rows exist per object (e.g., for different classes), ensure the total number of rows returned does not exceed 100, or clarify if the limit applies to unique objects.\n\n9. **Order of Operations:**\n   - Apply the filters and joins first, then apply the LIMIT clause to the final result set.\n\n10. **Summary of Steps:**\n    - Filter 'feature' for 'Multiband_period' < 5 and version 'lc_classifier_1.2.1-P'.\n    - Extract matching 'oid's.\n    - Query 'probability' for these 'oid's, with 'classifier_name' = 'lc_classifier' and 'ranking' in (1,2).\n    - Return all columns from 'probability' for these objects.\n    - Limit the result to 100 rows.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

Filter the 'feature' table for 'Multiband_period' < 5 and version 'lc_classifier_1.2.1-P'.\n2. Join the filtered 'feature' results to the 'probability' table on 'oid'.\n3. Filter the 'probability' table for 'classifier_name' = 'lc_classifier' and 'ranking' IN (1, 2).\n4. Select all columns from the 'probability' table for these objects.\n5. Limit the output to at most 100 objects (or rows, depending on interpretation).\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier'\n### IF THE 'feature' TABLE is used with 2 or more features, you need to take the following steps, because it is a transposed table (each feature is in a different row).\nI. Create a sub-query using the 'probability' TABLE filtering the desired objects.\nII. For each feature, you have to make a sub-query retrieving the specific feature adding the condition of its value, taking only the oids in the 'probability' sub-query with an INNER JOIN inside each 'feature' sub-query to retrieve only the features associated with the desired spatial objects.\nIII. Make an UNION between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nIV. Make an INTERSECT between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nV. Filter the 'UNION' query from step III selecting only the 'oids' that are in the 'INTERSECT' query from step IV\nVI. Add the remaining conditions to the final result of step V, using the 'probability' sub-query from step I.\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nTo generate a PostgreSQL query that retrieves all detections, non-detections, and forced photometry points for the ZTF object 'ZTF24aamtvxb', and returns all epochs in a single output table with the specified columns, follow this detailed decomposition plan:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Identify the Relevant Tables and Columns**\n\n- **detection**: Contains detections (light curve points).\n  - Columns needed: oid, mjd, fid, isdiffpos, magpsf, sigmapsf, diffmaglim\n- **non_detection**: Contains non-detections (upper limits).\n  - Columns needed: oid, mjd, fid, diffmaglim\n- **forced_photometry**: Contains forced photometry points.\n  - Columns needed: oid, mjd, fid, isdiffpos, mag, e_mag, diffmaglim\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Define the Output Columns**\n\nFor each epoch (row), the output table must include:\n- ZTF identifier (oid)\n- epoch date (mjd)\n- filter identifier (fid)\n- isdiffpos flag (isdiffpos)\n- detection difference magnitude (magpsf for detection, NULL otherwise)\n- detection magnitude uncertainty (sigmapsf for detection, NULL otherwise)\n- 5-sigma magnitude limit (diffmaglim)\n- forced difference magnitude (mag for forced_photometry, NULL otherwise)\n- forced magnitude uncertainty (e_mag for forced_photometry, NULL otherwise)\n- table (a string literal indicating the source table: 'detection', 'non_detection', or 'forced_photometry')\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Construct Subqueries for Each Table**\n\n#### a. **Detection Table Subquery**\n- Select all rows from detection where oid = 'ZTF24aamtvxb'.\n- For each row, select:\n  - oid as ZTF identifier\n  - mjd as epoch date\n  - fid as filter identifier\n  - isdiffpos\n  - magpsf as detection difference magnitude\n  - sigmapsf as detection magnitude uncertainty\n  - diffmaglim as 5-sigma magnitude limit\n  - NULL as forced difference magnitude\n  - NULL as forced magnitude uncertainty\n  - 'detection' as table\n\n#### b. **Non-Detection Table Subquery**\n- Select all rows from non_detection where oid = 'ZTF24aamtvxb'.\n- For each row, select:\n  - oid as ZTF identifier\n  - mjd as epoch date\n  - fid as filter identifier\n  - NULL as isdiffpos\n  - NULL as detection difference magnitude\n  - NULL as detection magnitude uncertainty\n  - diffmaglim as 5-sigma magnitude limit\n  - NULL as forced difference magnitude\n  - NULL as forced magnitude uncertainty\n  - 'non_detection' as table\n\n#### c. **Forced Photometry Table Subquery**\n- Select all rows from forced_photometry where oid = 'ZTF24aamtvxb'.\n- For each row, select:\n  - oid as ZTF identifier\n  - mjd as epoch date\n  - fid as filter identifier\n  - isdiffpos\n  - NULL as detection difference magnitude\n  - NULL as detection magnitude uncertainty\n  - diffmaglim as 5-sigma magnitude limit\n  - mag as forced difference magnitude\n  - e_mag as forced magnitude uncertainty\n  - 'forced_photometry' as table\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Combine the Subqueries**\n\n- Use a `UNION ALL` to combine the three subqueries, ensuring all epochs from all three tables are included in the output.\n- Ensure the column order and types match across all subqueries.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Order the Results (Optional)**\n\n- Optionally, order the combined results by epoch date (mjd) and filter identifier (fid) for easier chronological analysis.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Final Output**\n\n- The final result will be a single table with all epochs (detections, non-detections, and forced photometry) for the object 'ZTF24aamtvxb', with the specified columns and a 'table' column indicating the source.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Steps:**\n1. Identify and select the required columns from each table for the specified object.\n2. For each table, create a subquery with the required columns, using NULLs for columns not present in that table, and a literal for the 'table' column.\n3. Combine the subqueries using UNION ALL.\n4. (Optionally) Order the results by mjd and fid.\n\nNo SQL code is provided, only the step-by-step decomposition and logic for constructing the query.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

Create a subquery for the stamp classifier probability with the specified conditions.\n2. Create a subquery for the light curve classifier top probability with the specified conditions.\n3. Join both subqueries with the `object` table on `oid`.\n4. Apply the detection count filter (`ndet > 10`).\n5. Select the required columns, using aliases for the probability columns.\n6. Order the results by ZTF identifier.\n7. Limit the output to 30 rows.\n\n---\n\nThis plan ensures all conditions are met, the correct columns are selected and named, and the results are ordered and limited as requested.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query.

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier' ; this will return the classifications by the light curve classifier\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n# If you need to use 2 tables, try using a INNER JOIN statement, or a sub-query over 'probability' or 'object', if the query requires it. It is important to be really careful with the use of sub-queries or JOINs, as they can slow down the query.\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Answer ONLY with the final SQL query, with the following format: \n  ```sql SQL_QUERY_HERE ```\nDON'T include anything else in your answer. If you want to add comments, use the SQL comment format inside the query.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nDecomposition Plan:\n\n1. **Identify the Main Table for Output**  \n   - The user requests all columns from the 'object' table, so the main SELECT will be from the 'object' table.\n\n2. **Set the Output Limit**  \n   - The user wants at most 20 objects, so a LIMIT 20 clause will be required.\n\n3. **Apply Minimum Number of Detections Condition**  \n   - The user specifies a minimum number of detections of 30.  \n   - This corresponds to the 'ndet' column in the 'object' table.  \n   - Add a condition: object.ndet >= 30.\n\n4. **Apply Minimum Time Difference Condition**  \n   - The user specifies a difference between last and first detection times larger than 20 days.  \n   - This corresponds to the difference: object.lastmjd - object.firstmjd > 20.\n\n5. **Calculate the Difference Between Minimum g- and r-band Corrected Magnitudes**  \n   - The user wants the difference between minimum g- and r-band corrected magnitudes to be larger than 3.5.  \n   - These values are in the 'magstat' table:  \n     - 'magmin_corr' for the minimum corrected magnitude  \n     - 'fid' indicates the band: 1 for g-band, 2 for r-band  \n   - For each object, retrieve 'magmin_corr' where fid=1 (g-band) and 'magmin_corr' where fid=2 (r-band).  \n   - Compute the absolute difference: |magmin_corr_g - magmin_corr_r| > 3.5.\n\n6. **Join 'object' and 'magstat' Tables**  \n   - Since 'magmin_corr' values for both bands are in 'magstat', and the main output is from 'object', join 'object' with two instances of 'magstat':  \n     - One for g-band (alias as mg, with fid=1)  \n     - One for r-band (alias as mr, with fid=2)  \n   - Join condition: object.oid = mg.oid and object.oid = mr.oid.\n\n7. **Apply the Magnitude Difference Condition**  \n   - Add a condition: ABS(mg.magmin_corr - mr.magmin_corr) > 3.5.\n\n8. **Select All Columns from 'object' Table**  \n   - Ensure the SELECT statement returns all columns from the 'object' table.\n\n9. **Combine All Conditions**  \n   - Ensure all the above conditions are included in the WHERE clause.\n\n10. **Order of Operations**  \n    - The join and filtering on magnitude difference must occur before applying the LIMIT, to ensure only objects meeting all criteria are returned.\n\nSummary of Steps:\n- Start with the 'object' table.\n- Join with 'magstat' twice to get g- and r-band minimum corrected magnitudes.\n- Filter for objects with ndet >= 30.\n- Filter for objects with (lastmjd - firstmjd) > 20.\n- Filter for objects with |magmin_corr_g - magmin_corr_r| > 3.5.\n- Return all columns from 'object'.\n- Limit the result to 20 objects.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Get at most 20 ZTF objects that satisfy the following conditions: a minimum number of detections of 30, a difference between minimum g- and r-band corrected magnitudes larger than 3.5, and difference between last and first detection times larger than 20 days.

this only return the most likely probabilities, if the user request all ranking probabilities, don't use it.\n- 'probability.classifier_name='lc_classifier'\n### IF THE 'feature' TABLE is used with 2 or more features, you need to take the following steps, because it is a transposed table (each feature is in a different row).\nI. Create a sub-query using the 'probability' TABLE filtering the desired objects.\nII. For each feature, you have to make a sub-query retrieving the specific feature adding the condition of its value, taking only the oids in the 'probability' sub-query with an INNER JOIN inside each 'feature' sub-query to retrieve only the features associated with the desired spatial objects.\nIII. Make an UNION between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nIV. Make an INTERSECT between the sub-queries of each feature from step II\nV. Filter the 'UNION' query from step III selecting only the 'oids' that are in the 'INTERSECT' query from step IV\nVI. Add the remaining conditions to the final result of step V, using the 'probability' sub-query from step I.\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nHere is a detailed decomposition plan for generating the required PostgreSQL query, step by step, using the ALeRCE database schema and context:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Identify Required Columns and Their Tables**\n   - **Object identifier:** `object.oid`\n   - **Candidate identifier:** `detection.candid`\n   - **Filter id (as 'f_id'):** `detection.fid`\n   - **Coordinates:** `detection.ra`, `detection.dec`\n   - **Magnitude:** `detection.magpsf`\n   - **Magnitude errors:** `detection.sigmapsf`\n   - **Corrected difference magnitude in r-band:** `detection.magpsf_corr` (for r-band, i.e., `fid=2`)\n   - **PSF corrected magnitude in r-filter:** `detection.magpsf_corr` (for r-band, i.e., `fid=2`)\n   - **Maximum rise from minimum in each detection:** Need to compute, for each object, the difference between the maximum and minimum `magpsf_corr` in r-band (`fid=2`).\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Filter Objects by Classification**\n   - Use the `probability` table to select objects where:\n     - `probability.class_name = 'CV/Nova'`\n     - `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier_stochastic'`\n     - `probability.ranking = 1` (default condition)\n   - This gives the set of oids (object identifiers) for objects classified as CV/Nova by the stochastic light curve classifier.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Filter Objects by Number of Detections**\n   - Use the `object` table to filter objects with:\n     - `object.ndet <= 50`\n   - Join this with the filtered oids from the previous step to ensure only objects with at most 50 detections are included.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Select Only r-band Detections**\n   - Use the `detection` table, filtering for:\n     - `detection.fid = 2` (r-band)\n   - Join with the filtered oids from step 3 to get only relevant detections.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Compute Maximum Rise from Minimum in Each Detection**\n   - For each object (`oid`), in the r-band (`fid=2`), calculate:\n     - The maximum value of `detection.magpsf_corr`\n     - The minimum value of `detection.magpsf_corr`\n     - The difference between these two values (i.e., `max - min`) as the \"maximum rise from minimum\"\n   - This requires a subquery or a window function to compute the max and min per object.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Assemble the Final Result Set**\n   - For each detection (row) that matches the above filters, select:\n     - `object.oid`\n     - `detection.candid`\n     - `detection.fid` (as `f_id`)\n     - `detection.ra`\n     - `detection.dec`\n     - `detection.magpsf`\n     - `detection.sigmapsf`\n     - `detection.magpsf_corr` (corrected difference magnitude in r-band)\n     - The computed \"maximum rise from minimum\" for the object in r-band (as a column, same value for all detections of the same object)\n   - Use INNER JOINs between `probability`, `object`, and `detection` as needed.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Order and Limit the Results**\n   - Order the results by `object.oid` (object identifier).\n   - Limit the output to the first 1000 rows.\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Summary of Query Structure**\n   - **Subquery 1:** Select oids from `probability` where class is 'CV/Nova', classifier is 'lc_classifier_stochastic', and ranking is 1.\n   - **Subquery 2:** Join with `object` to filter for `ndet <= 50`.\n   - **Subquery 3:** Join with `detection` for r-band (`fid=2`), select required columns.\n   - **Subquery 4:** For each oid, compute max and min of `magpsf_corr` in r-band, and their difference.\n   - **Final Query:** Join the detection rows with the computed max-min difference per oid, select all required columns, order by oid, and limit to 1000 rows.\n\n---\n\n### 9. **Details for Each Step**\n   - All joins should be INNER JOINs to ensure only objects meeting all criteria are included.\n   - The computation of the \"maximum rise from minimum\" should be done per object, and then joined back to the detection rows for that object.\n   - All columns should be selected as specified, with aliases where needed (e.g., `detection.fid AS f_id`).\n   - Ensure that only detections in the r-band are included in the final result.\n\n---\n\nThis plan ensures that all required filters, computations, and selections are performed optimally and accurately, using the correct table and column names, and following the default and context-specific conditions for the ALeRCE database.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Get the columns that contains: object identifier, candidate identifier, filter id as 'f_id', co-ordinates, magnitude, magnitude errors.

This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\n**Decomposition Plan for the Query:**\n\n1. **Identify Required Columns and Their Tables:**\n   - Object identifier: `object.oid`\n   - Candidate identifier: `detection.candid`\n   - Filter id (as 'f_id'): `detection.fid`\n   - Coordinates: `detection.ra`, `detection.dec`\n   - Magnitude: `detection.magpsf`\n   - Magnitude errors: `detection.sigmapsf`\n   - Corrected difference magnitude in r-band: `detection.magpsf_corr` (for r-band, i.e., `detection.fid = 2`)\n   - PSF corrected magnitude in r-filter: `detection.magpsf_corr` (for r-band)\n   - Maximum rise from minimum in each detection: Need to compute the difference between the maximum and minimum `magpsf_corr` for each object in r-band.\n\n2. **Filter Objects by Classification:**\n   - Use the `probability` table to select objects where:\n     - `probability.class_name = 'CV/Nova'`\n     - `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier_stochastic'`\n     - `probability.ranking = 1` (default condition)\n   - Join this with the `object` table to get object-level statistics.\n\n3. **Filter by Number of Detections:**\n   - Only include objects with `object.ndet <= 50` (number of detections from discovery to last detection).\n\n4. **Filter Detections in r-band:**\n   - Only consider detections where `detection.fid = 2` (r-band).\n\n5. **Join Tables Appropriately:**\n   - Join `probability` (filtered as above) to `object` on `oid`.\n   - Join the result to `detection` on `oid` to get detection-level data.\n\n6. **Compute Maximum Rise from Minimum in Each Detection:**\n   - For each object, in the r-band, calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum `magpsf_corr` values across all detections.\n   - This requires a subquery or window function to compute `MAX(detection.magpsf_corr) - MIN(detection.magpsf_corr)` for each `oid`.\n\n7. **Select and Alias Columns:**\n   - Select the required columns, aliasing `detection.fid` as `f_id`.\n   - Include the computed maximum rise from minimum as a column.\n\n8. **Limit and Order Results:**\n   - Limit the result to the first 1000 rows.\n   - Order the results by `object.oid`.\n\n9. **Summary of Steps/Subqueries:**\n   - **Subquery 1:** Filter `probability` for `class_name = 'CV/Nova'`, `classifier_name = 'lc_classifier_stochastic'`, and `ranking = 1`.\n   - **Subquery 2:** Join Subquery 1 to `object` and filter for `object.ndet <= 50`.\n   - **Subquery 3:** Join Subquery 2 to `detection` and filter for `detection.fid = 2`.\n   - **Subquery 4:** For each `oid`, compute `MAX(detection.magpsf_corr) - MIN(detection.magpsf_corr)` as the maximum rise from minimum in r-band.\n   - **Final Selection:** Select the required columns from Subquery 3, include the computed maximum rise from Subquery 4, limit to 1000 rows, and order by `object.oid`.\n\n10. **Details for Each Step:**\n    - Ensure all joins are INNER JOINs to enforce the filtering at each stage.\n    - Use GROUP BY or window functions as needed for the maximum rise calculation.\n    - Ensure that only detections in the r-band are considered for magnitude and error columns, as well as for the rise calculation.\n\n**This plan ensures all required information is retrieved, filtered, and computed as per the user\u2019s advanced query, using optimal joins and subqueries, and following all default and context-specific conditions.**\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Get the columns that contains: object identifier, candidate identifier, filter id as 'f_id', co-ordinates, magnitude, magnitude errors.

Add the remaining conditions to the final result of step V, using the 'probability' sub-query from step I.\n### GENERAL\n### Important points to consider\n- If the user doesn't specify explicit columns or information that is not in a column, choose all the columns, for example by using the \u201cSELECT *\u201d SQL statement, from ALL the tables used, including the ones from the sub-queries.\n- Mantain the EXACT COLUMN names as they are in the database, unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the request, giving you the new name to use. This is crucial for the query to work correctly.\n- Mantain the exact class names as they are in the database, marked with single quotes, for example, 'SNIa'.\n\n\n# If you need to use 2 or 3 tables, try using a sub-query or INNER JOIN over 'probability' TABLE or 'object' TABLE, or an INNER JOIN between 'probabbility' and 'object', or over an INNER JOIN between 'probability', 'object' and 'magstat', if it is necessary (priority in this order).\n# Answer ONLY with the SQL query, do not include any additional or explanatory text. If you want to add something, add COMMENTS IN PostgreSQL format so that the user can understand.\n# Finally, join all the steps in a final query, with the following format: \n```sql [FINAL QUERY HERE] ```\nDON'T include anything else inside and after your FINAL answer.\n\n# Use the next decomposed planification to write the query:\nHere is a detailed decomposition plan for generating the required PostgreSQL query, step by step, using the ALeRCE database schema and all the context and constraints provided:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Identify and List Required Columns**\n   - **Object identifier**: `object.oid`\n   - **Candidate identifier**: `detection.candid`\n   - **Filter id (as 'f_id')**: `detection.fid` (alias as `f_id`)\n   - **Coordinates**: `detection.ra`, `detection.dec`\n   - **Magnitude**: `detection.magpsf_corr` (PSF corrected magnitude)\n   - **Magnitude errors**: `detection.sigmapsf_corr` (error of PSF corrected magnitude)\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Filter for CV/Nova Class by Stochastic Light Curve Classifier**\n   - Use the `probability` table.\n   - Filter where:\n     - `probability.class_name = 'CV/Nova'`\n     - `probability.classifier_name = 'lc_classifier_stochastic'`\n     - `probability.ranking = 1` (default condition)\n   - This subquery will give the oids of objects classified as CV/Nova with the highest probability by the stochastic classifier.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Filter Objects by Number of Detections**\n   - Use the `object` table.\n   - Condition: `object.ndet <= 50`\n   - This ensures only objects with at most 50 detections from discovery to last detection are included.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Restrict to r-band Filter and Corrected Magnitude**\n   - Use the `detection` table.\n   - Condition: `detection.fid = 2` (r-band filter)\n   - Condition: `detection.corrected = TRUE` (to ensure corrected magnitudes are used)\n   - Select only the relevant columns for magnitude and error: `magpsf_corr`, `sigmapsf_corr`.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Join Tables to Collect All Required Information**\n   - Join `probability` (filtered for CV/Nova, stochastic, rank 1) to `object` on `oid`.\n   - Join the result to `detection` on `oid`.\n   - Ensure that only detections in the r-band and with corrected magnitudes are included.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Calculate Maximum Rise from Minimum in Each Detection**\n   - For each object (`oid`), in the r-band, find the minimum and maximum `magpsf_corr` values from the `detection` table.\n   - Compute the difference: `max(magpsf_corr) - min(magpsf_corr)` for each object.\n   - This can be done using a window function or a GROUP BY subquery.\n   - Attach this value to each detection row for the corresponding object.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Select and Alias Columns Appropriately**\n   - Select the following columns:\n     - `object.oid`\n     - `detection.candid`\n     - `detection.fid AS f_id`\n     - `detection.ra`\n     - `detection.dec`\n     - `detection.magpsf_corr`\n     - `detection.sigmapsf_corr`\n     - The computed maximum rise from minimum for each object (as a new column, e.g., `max_rise_from_min`).\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Order and Limit Results**\n   - Order the results by `object.oid`.\n   - Limit the output to the first 1000 rows.\n\n---\n\n### 9. **Summary of Subqueries and Joins**\n   - **Subquery 1**: Select oids from `probability` where class is 'CV/Nova', classifier is 'lc_classifier_stochastic', and ranking is 1.\n   - **Subquery 2**: Select oids from `object` where ndet <= 50.\n   - **Intersection**: Only keep oids present in both subqueries.\n   - **Main Query**: Join the filtered oids to `detection` (on oid), filter for r-band and corrected, select required columns.\n   - **Aggregate Subquery**: For each oid, compute max and min `magpsf_corr` in r-band, and their difference.\n   - **Final Join**: Attach the aggregate value to each detection row for the corresponding object.\n\n---\n\n### 10. **Final Output**\n   - The result will be a table with up to 1000 rows, each containing:\n     - Object identifier\n     - Candidate identifier\n     - Filter id (as f_id)\n     - RA, Dec\n     - PSF corrected magnitude and its error in r-band\n     - Maximum rise from minimum in r-band for the object\n   - All objects are CV/Nova by stochastic classifier, with at most 50 detections, and only r-band, corrected detections are included.\n   - Results are ordered by object identifier.\n\n---\n\nThis plan ensures all required filtering, joining, aggregation, and output formatting steps are covered, using the correct tables, columns, and default conditions as specified in the context.\n# If there is SQL code, use it only as reference, changing the conditions you consider necessary.\n# You can join some of the steps if you consider it better for the query. For example, if 2 or more use the same table and are not requested to be different sub-queries, then you can join them.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "# Important Information for the query\nExternal Knowledge: 0\nDomain Knowledge: 0\n # User Request: ''Get the columns that contains: object identifier, candidate identifier, filter id as 'f_id', co-ordinates, magnitude, magnitude errors.
