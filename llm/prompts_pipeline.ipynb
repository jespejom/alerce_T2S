    "- Formatting: Use markdown features for readability. DO NOT USE ``` CODE BLOCKS UNLESS SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED.\n",

If they are vague, consider breaking down into sub-steps. Keep any details, guidelines, examples, variables, or placeholders provided by the user.\n",
    "- Constants: DO include constants in the prompt, as they are not susceptible to prompt injection. Such as guides, rubrics, and examples.\n",

      "As a SQL expert with a willingness to assist users, you are tasked with crafting a PostgreSQL query for the Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events (ALeRCE) Database in 2023. This database serves as a repository for information about individual spatial objects, encompassing various statistics, properties, detections, and features observed by survey telescopes. The tables within the database are categorized into three types: time and band independent (e.g., object, probability), time-independent (e.g., magstats), and time and band-dependent (e.g., detection). Your role involves carefully analyzing user requests, considering the specifics of the given tables. It is crucial to pay attention to explicit conditions outlined by the user and always maintain awareness of the broader context. ALeRCE processes data from the alert stream of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), so unless a specific catalog is mentioned, the data is from ZTF, including the object, candidate and filter identifiers, and other relevant information. The user values the personality of a knowledgeable SQL expert, so ensuring accuracy is paramount. Be thorough in understanding and addressing the user's request, taking into account both explicit conditions and the overall context for effective communication and assistance.\n",

      "Given the following text, please thoroughly analyze and provide a detailed explanation of your understanding. Be explicit in highlighting any ambiguity or areas where the information is unclear. If there are multiple possible interpretations, consider and discuss each one. Additionally, if any terms or concepts are unfamiliar, explain how you've interpreted them based on context or inquire for clarification. Your goal is to offer a comprehensive and clear interpretation while acknowledging and addressing potential challenges in comprehension. \"## General Information about the Schema and Database - Prioritize obtaining OIDs in a subquery to optimize the main query. - Utilize nested queries to retrieve OIDs, preferably selecting the 'probability' or 'object' table. - Avoid JOIN clauses; instead, favor nested queries. ## Default Parameters to Consider - Class probabilities for a given classifier and object are sorted from most to least likely, indicated by the 'ranking' column in the probability table. Hence, the most probable class should have 'ranking'=1. - The ALeRCE classification pipeline includes a Stamp Classifier and a Light Curve Classifier. The Light Curve classifier employs a hierarchical method, being the most general. If no classifier is specified, use 'classifier_name='lc_classifier' when selecting probabilities. - If the user doesn't specify explicit columns, use the \"SELECT *\" SQL statement to choose all possible columns. - Avoid changing the names of columns or tables unless necessary for the SQL query. ## ALeRCE Pipeline Details - Stamp Classifier (denoted as 'stamp_classifier'): All alerts related to new objects undergo stamp-based classification. - Light Curve Classifier (denoted as 'lc_classifier'): A balanced hierarchical random forest classifier employing four models and 15 classes. - The first hierarchical classifier has three classes: [Periodic, Stochastic, Transient], denoted as 'lc_classifier_top.' - Three additional classifiers specialize in different spatial object types: Periodic, Transient, and Stochastic, denoted as 'lc_classifier_periodic', 'lc_classifier_transient', and 'lc_classifier_stochastic', respectively. - The 15 classes are separated for each object type: - Transient: [SNe Ia ('SNIa'), SNe Ib/c ('SNIbc'), SNe II ('SNII'), and Super Luminous SNe ('SLSN')]. - Stochastic: [Active Galactic Nuclei ('AGN'), Quasi Stellar Object ('QSO'), 'Blazar', Cataclysmic Variable/Novae ('CV/Nova'), and Young Stellar Object ('YSO')]. - Periodic: [Delta Scuti ('DSCT'), RR Lyrae ('RRL'), Cepheid ('CEP'), Long Period Variable ('LPV'), Eclipsing Binary ('E'), and other periodic objects ('Periodic-Other')]. ## Probability Variable Names - classifier_name=('lc_classifier', 'lc_classifier_top', 'lc_classifier_transient', 'lc_classifier_stochastic', 'lc_classifier_periodic', 'stamp_classifier') - Classes in 'lc_classifier'= ('SNIa', 'SNIbc', 'SNII', 'SLSN', 'QSO', 'AGN', 'Blazar', 'CV/Nova', 'YSO', 'LPV', 'E', 'DSCT', 'RRL', 'CEP', 'Periodic-Other') - Classes in 'lc_classifier_top'= ('Transient', 'Stochastic', 'Periodic') - Classes in 'lc_classifier_transient'= ('SNIa', 'SNIbc', 'SNII', 'SLSN') - Classes in 'lc_classifier_stochastic'= ('QSO', 'AGN', 'Blazar', 'CV/Nova', 'YSO') - Classes in 'lc_classifier_periodic'= ('LPV', 'E', 'DSCT', 'RRL', 'CEP', 'Periodic-Other') - Classes in 'stamp_classifier'= ('SN', 'AGN', 'VS', 'asteroid', 'bogus')\"\n",

      "\n",
      "The following functions are available in the Q3C extension: - q3c_dist(ra1, dec1, ra2, dec2) -- returns the distance in degrees between two points (ra1,dec1) and (ra2,dec2) - q3c_join(ra1, dec1, ra2, dec2, radius) -- returns true if (ra1, dec1) is within radius spherical distance of (ra2, dec2). - q3c_ellipse_join(ra1, dec1, ra2, dec2, major, ratio, pa) -- like q3c_join, except (ra1, dec1) have to be within an ellipse with semi-major axis major, the axis ratio ratio and the position angle pa (from north through east) - q3c_radial_query(ra, dec, center_ra, center_dec, radius) -- returns true if ra, dec is within radius degrees of center_ra, center_dec. This is the main function for cone searches. - q3c_ellipse_query(ra, dec, center_ra, center_dec, maj_ax, axis_ratio, PA ) -- returns true if ra, dec is within the ellipse from center_ra, center_dec. The ellipse is specified by semi-major axis, axis ratio and positional angle. - q3c_poly_query(ra, dec, poly) -- returns true if ra, dec is within the spherical polygon specified as an array of right ascensions and declinations. Alternatively poly can be an PostgreSQL polygon type.\n",

This construct creates a temporary inline table named catalog, which can be used in subsequent queries for cross-matching or spatial filtering operations. This is useful for defining a set of astronomical sources with associated coordinates directly in a SQL query. Then, you can use the Q3C functions to perform spatial queries on this temporary table (e.g. 'FROM catalog c').

      "1. **Understand the Database Schema:**\n",
      "   - Obtain the database schema, which includes tables, columns, data types, relationships, and constraints.\n",
      "   - Identify the relevant tables and columns that contain the information you need.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Define the Information Needed:**\n",
      "   - Clearly specify what information you want to retrieve. For example, you might be interested in transient events, their classifications, light curves, or cross-matches with other catalogs.\n",
      "   - Determine the level of detail required (e.g., specific time ranges, magnitude limits, or particular sky regions).\n",

      "4. **Design the Query:**\n",

      "\n",
      "5. **Document the Query:**\n",
      "   - Write comments within the SQL code to explain the purpose of different parts of the query.\n",

      "Creating a decomposition plan to generate a PostgreSQL query for retrieving information from the ALeRCE astronomy broker database involves several steps. ALeRCE (Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events) is a system designed to classify large amounts of astronomical data, typically from surveys like the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). To create a detailed and understandable plan, follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Understand the Database Schema:**\n",
      "   - Obtain the database schema, which includes tables, columns, data types, relationships, and constraints.\n",
      "   - Identify the relevant tables and columns that contain the information you need.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Define the Information Needed:**\n",
      "   - Clearly specify what information you want to retrieve. For example, you might be interested in transient events, their classifications, light curves, or cross-matches with other catalogs.\n",
      "   - Determine the level of detail required (e.g., specific time ranges, magnitude limits, or particular sky regions).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Formulate the Query Requirements:**\n",
      "   - Decide on the selection criteria (e.g., date, magnitude, classification confidence).\n",
      "   - Determine if you need to join multiple tables and how they are related.\n",
      "   - Consider if you need to aggregate data (e.g., average magnitudes, count of events).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Design the Query:**\n",
      "   - Start with the main table that contains the bulk of the information you need.\n",
      "   - Use `JOIN` clauses to combine related tables based on common keys.\n",
      "   - Apply `WHERE` clauses to filter the data according to your criteria.\n",
      "   - Use `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions if necessary.\n",
      "   - Decide on the sorting order of the results using `ORDER BY`.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Document the Query:**\n",
      "   - Write comments within the SQL code to explain the purpose of different parts of the query.\n",
      "   - Create external documentation that describes the query's purpose, the information it retrieves, and any assumptions or limitations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember that the actual query will depend on the specific schema and requirements of the ALeRCE database. Always test your queries to ensure they perform as expected and return accurate results. \n",
